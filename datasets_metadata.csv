This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund (PRF) money and these payments do not need to be repaid.

The Department allocated $50 billion in PRF payments for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement.

10,United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County,"Reporting of Aggregate Case and Death Count data was discontinued May 11, 2023, with the expiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration. Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.

This archived public use dataset has 11 data elements reflecting United States COVID-19 community levels for all available counties. 

The COVID-19 community levels were developed using a combination of three metrics — new COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, and total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. The COVID-19 community level was determined by the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. New COVID-19 admissions and the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied represent the current potential for strain on the health system. Data on new cases acts as an early warning indicator of potential increases in health system strain in the event of a COVID-19 surge.

Using these data, the COVID-19 community level was classified as low, medium, or high.

COVID-19 Community Levels were used to help communities and individuals make decisions based on their local context and their unique needs. Community vaccination coverage and other local information, like early alerts from surveillance, such as through wastewater or the number of emergency department visits for COVID-19, when available, can also inform decision making for health officials and individuals.

For the most accurate and up-to-date data for any county or state, visit the relevant health department website. COVID Data Tracker may display data that differ from state and local websites. This can be due to differences in how data were collected, how metrics were calculated, or the timing of web updates.

<b>Archived Data Notes:</b>

This dataset was renamed from ""United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County as Originally Posted"" to ""United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County"" on March 31, 2022. 

<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Column name for county population was changed to “county_population”. No change was made to the data points previous released.

<b>March 31, 2022:</b> New column, “health_service_area_population”, was added to the dataset to denote the total population in the designated Health Service Area based on 2019 Census estimate. 

<b>March 31, 2022:</b> FIPS codes for territories American Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and United States Virgin Islands were re-formatted to 5-digit numeric for records released on 3/3/2022 to be consistent with other records in the dataset.

<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Changes were made to the text fields in variables “county”, “state”, and “health_service_area” so the formats are consistent across releases.

<b>March 31, 2022:</b> The “%” sign was removed from the text field in column “covid_inpatient_bed_utilization”. No change was made to the data. As indicated in the column description, values in this column represent the percentage of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients (7-day average).  

<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Data values for columns, “county_population”, “health_service_area_number”, and “health_service_area” were backfilled for records released on 2/24/2022. These columns were added since the week of 3/3/2022, thus the values were previously missing for records released the week prior.

Dataset and data visualization details:
These data were posted on October 21, 2022, archived on November 18, 2022, and revised on February 22, 2023. These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. 

Vaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series ≥14 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.
Additional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type. 
** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.
Deaths: A COVID-19–associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.
Participating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

<b>Overview</b>

The COVID-19 case surveillance database includes individual-level data reported to U.S. states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as well as U.S. territories and affiliates. On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the <a href=""https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/search-results-year/"">Nationally Notifiable Condition List</a> and classified as “immediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)” by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (<a href=""https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID",N/A,19

19,Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19,"Effective September 27, 2023, this dataset will no longer be updated. Similar data are accessible from wonder.cdc.gov.

Estimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to COVID-19, beyond the number of deaths that are directly attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.

Estimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction. More detail about the methods, weighting, data, and limitations can be found in the Technical Notes.",N/A,14

The program funding information is as follow:

TESTING
The American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) which provided $4.8 billion to reimburse providers for testing the uninsured; the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) Relief Fund, which includes funds received from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, as appropriated in the FFCRCA (P.L. 116-127) and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (P.L. 116-139) (PPPHCEA), which each appropriated $1 billion to reimburse health care entities for conducting COVID-19 testing for the uninsured.
 
TREATMENT & VACCINATION
The Provider Relief Fund, which includes funds received from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, as appropriated in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (P.L. 116-136), provided $100 billion in relief funds. The PPPHCEA appropriated an additional $75 billion in relief funds and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act (P.L. 116-260) appropriated another $3 billion. Within the Provider Relief Fund, a portion of the funding from these sources will be used to support healthcare-related expenses attributable to the treatment of uninsured individuals with COVID-19 and vaccination of uninsured individuals.

<b>Related data</b>
CDC has been providing the public with two versions of COVID-19 county-level community transmission level data: this dataset with the daily values as originally posted on the COVID Data Tracker, and an historical dataset with daily data as well as the updates and corrections from state and local health departments. Similar to this dataset, the <a href=""https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn"">original historical dataset</a> is archived on 10/20/2022. It will continue to be publicly available but will no longer be updated. A new dataset containing historical community transmission data by county is now published weekly and can be found at: <a href=""https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn"">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission Historical Changes | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>.

This public use dataset has 7 data elements reflecting community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions. It contains reported daily transmission levels at the county level with the same values used to display transmission maps on the COVID Data Tracker. Each day, the dataset is appended to contain the most recent day's data. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.

<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>
The County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down"">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.

<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>

<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> ""New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days"" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. ""New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days"" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).

<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> ""Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days"" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests conducted over the last 7 days. ""Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days"" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00).

Dataset and data visualization details:
These data were posted on October 21, 2022, archived on November 18, 2022, and revised on February 22, 2023. These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. 

Vaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series ≥14 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.
Additional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.
** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.
Deaths: A COVID-19–associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.
Participating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

41,Weekly United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State - ARCHIVED,"Reporting of new Aggregate Case and Death Count data was discontinued May 11, 2023, with the expiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration. This dataset will receive a final update on June 1, 2023, to reconcile historical data through May 10, 2023, and will remain publicly available.

<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process </b>
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, data have been gathered through a robust process with the following steps: 
<ul><li>A CDC data team reviews and validates the information obtained from jurisdictions’ state and local websites via an overnight data review process.</li>
<li>If more than one official county data source exists, CDC uses a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source, and takes the highest case and death counts respectively, unless otherwise specified by the state. </li>
<li>CDC compiles these data and posts the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker. </li>
<li>County level data is aggregated to obtain state and territory specific totals.</li>
</ul>This process is collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provide the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. CDC may retrospectively update counts to correct data quality issues. 

<b>Methodology Changes </b>
Several differences exist between the current, weekly-updated dataset and the archived version: 
<ul><li><b>Source:</b> The current Weekly-Updated Version is based on county-level aggregate count data, while the Archived Version is based on State-level aggregate count data. </li>
<li><b>Confirmed/Probable Cases/Death breakdown: </b> While the probable cases and deaths are included in the total case and total death counts in both versions (if applicable), they were reported separately from the confirmed cases and deaths by jurisdiction in the Archived Version.  In the current Weekly-Updated Version, the counts by jurisdiction are not reported by confirmed or probable status (See Confirmed and Probable Counts section for more detail).</li>
<li><b>Time Series Frequency:</b> The current Weekly-Updated Version contains weekly time series data (i.e., one record per week per jurisdiction), while the Archived Version contains daily time series data (i.e., one record per day per jurisdiction). </li>
<li><b>Update Frequency:</b> The current Weekly-Updated Version is updated weekly, while the Archived Version was updated twice daily up to October 20, 2022. </li></ul>
<b>Important note:</b> The counts reflected during a given time period in this dataset may not match the counts reflected for the same time period in the archived dataset noted above. Discrepancies may exist due to differences between county and state COVID-19 case surveillance and reconciliation efforts. 

<b>Confirmed and Probable Counts </b>
In this dataset, counts by jurisdiction are not displayed by confirmed or probable status. Instead, confirmed and probable cases and deaths are included in the Total Cases and Total Deaths columns, when available. Not all jurisdictions report probable cases and deaths to CDC.* Confirmed and probable case definition criteria are described here:

Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates after 2010 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.

Causes of death classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10) are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to rankable causes. Cause of death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.

Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts.

Several data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts. Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made.

Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations.

57,"PLACES: Local Data for Better Health, County Data 2024 release","This dataset contains model-based county estimates. PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. This dataset includes estimates for 40 measures: 12 for health outcomes, 7 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, 3 for health status, and 7 for health-related social needs. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2022 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey 2018–2022 estimates. The 2024 release uses 2022 BRFSS data for 36 measures and 2021 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening, and taking medicine for high blood pressure control among those with high blood pressure) that the survey collects data on every other year.

58,United States COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission Historical Changes - ARCHIVED,"On October 20, 2022, CDC began retrieving aggregate case and death data from jurisdictional and state partners weekly instead of daily. This dataset contains archived historical community transmission and related data elements by county. Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset has not been updated since October 20, 2022. An archived dataset containing weekly historical community transmission data by county can also be found here: <a href=""https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn"">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission Historical Changes | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>. 

<b>Related data</b>
CDC has been providing the public with two versions of COVID-19 county-level community transmission level data: this historical dataset with the daily county-level transmission data from January 22, 2020, and a dataset with the daily values as originally posted on the COVID Data Tracker. Similar to this dataset, the <a href=""https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn"">original dataset</a> with daily data as posted is archived on 10/20/2022. It will continue to be publicly available but will no longer be updated. A new dataset containing community transmission data by county as originally posted is now published weekly and can be found at: <a href=""https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6"">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission as Originally Posted | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>.

This public use dataset has 7 data elements reflecting historical data for community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions. It contains historical data for the county level of community transmission and includes updated data submitted by states and jurisdictions. Each day, the dataset was updated to include the most recent days’ data and incorporate any historical changes made by jurisdictions. This dataset includes data since January 22, 2020. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.

<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>
The County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down"">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.

<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>

<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> ""New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days"" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. ""New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days"" is considered to have transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).

<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> ""Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days"" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests resulted over the last 7 days. ""Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days"" is considered to have transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substa",N/A,7
59,Provider Relief Fund by State,"HHS is providing support to healthcare providers fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security (CARES) Act; the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (PPPHCEA); and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act, which provide a total of $178 billion for relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund (PRF) money and these payments do not need to be repaid.

The Department allocated $50 billion in PRF payments for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. HHS has made other PRF distributions to a wide array of health care providers and more information on those distributions can be found here: <a href=""https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/cares-act-provider-relief-fund/data/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow external"">https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/cares-act-provider-relief-fund/data/index.html</a>",N/A,0
60,Indicators of Anxiety or Depression Based on Reported Frequency of Symptoms During Last 7 Days,"The U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with five federal agencies, launched the Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 on American households.  The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.

The survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely weekly estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself.

63,NCHS - Death rates and life expectancy at birth,"This dataset of U.S. mortality trends since 1900 highlights the differences in age-adjusted death rates and life expectancy at birth by race and sex.

Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000) after 1998 are calculated based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).

Life expectancy data are available up to 2017. Due to changes in categories of race used in publications, data are not available for the black population consistently before 1968, and not at all before 1960. More information on historical data on age-adjusted death rates is available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality/hist293.htm.

64,SARS-CoV-2 Variant Proportions,"To identify and track SARS-CoV-2 variants, CDC uses genomic surveillance. CDC's national genomic surveillance system collects SARS-CoV-2 specimens for sequencing through the National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance (NS3) program, as well as SARS-CoV-2 sequences generated by commercial or academic laboratories contracted by CDC and state or local public health laboratories. Viral genomic sequences are analyzed and classified as a particular variant. The proportions of variants in a population are estimated nationally, by HHS region, and by jurisdiction. The thousands of sequences analyzed every week through CDC’s national genomic sequencing and bioinformatics efforts fuel this comprehensive and population-based U.S. surveillance system established to identify and monitor the spread of variants.

To support state and local communication and outreach efforts, ASPE developed state, county, and sub-state level predictions of hesitancy rates (https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/vaccine-hesitancy) using the most recently available federal survey data.

We estimate hesitancy rates at the state level using the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey (HPS) (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html) data and utilize the estimated values to predict hesitancy rates at the Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMA) level using the Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS)(https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html). To create county-level estimates, we used a PUMA-to-county crosswalk from the Missouri Census Data Center(https://mcdc.missouri.edu/applications/geocorr2014.html). PUMAs spanning multiple counties had their estimates apportioned across those counties based on overall 2010 Census populations.

The HPS is nationally representative and includes information on U.S. residents’ intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine when available, as well as other sociodemographic and geographic (state, region and metropolitan statistical areas) information. The ACS is a nationally representative survey, and it provides key sociodemographic and geographic (state, region, PUMAs, county) information. We utilized data for the survey collection period May 26, 2021 – June 7, 2021, which the HPS refers to as Week 31..

PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 40 measures: 12 for health outcomes, 7 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, 3 for health status, and 7 for health-related social needs. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2020 population data, and American Community Survey 2018–2022 estimates. The 2024 release uses 2022 BRFSS data for 36 measures and 2021 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening, and taking medicine for high blood pressure control among those with high blood pressure) that the survey collects data on every other year.

85,"Provisional COVID-19 death counts, rates, and percent of total deaths, by jurisdiction of residence","This file contains COVID-19 death counts, death rates, and percent of total deaths by jurisdiction of residence. The data is grouped by different time periods including 3-month period, weekly, and total (cumulative since January 1, 2020). United States death counts and rates include the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia and New York City. New York state estimates exclude New York City. Puerto Rico is included in HHS Region 2 estimates.

Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1. Number of deaths reported in this file are the total number of COVID-19 deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and may not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Counts of deaths occurring before or after the reporting period are not included in the file.

Data during recent periods are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.

Death counts should not be compared across states. Data timeliness varies by state. Some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly. 

The ten (10) United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New Jersey, New York, New York City, Puerto Rico; Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.

Rates were calculated using the population estimates for 2021, which are estimated as of July 1, 2021 based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census PL 94-171 Redistricting File (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/methods-statement-v2021.pdf).

Rates are based on deaths occurring in the specified week/month and are age-adjusted to the 2000 standard population using the direct method (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-08-508.pdf). These rates differ from annual age-adjusted rates, typically presented in NCHS publications based on a full year of data and annualized weekly/monthly age-adjusted rates which have been adjusted to allow comparison with annual rates.  Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly/monthly) rate prevailed for a full year.

Sub-national death counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS data confidentiality standards. Rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS standards of reliability as specified in NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions (available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdf.).",N/A,14

This file was assembled by HHS via CMS, HRSA and reviewed by leadership and compares the HHS Provider Relief Fund and the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments by State and provider as of December 4, 2020.  

HHS Provider Relief Fund 
President Trump is providing support to healthcare providers fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which provide a total of $175 billion for relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund money and these payments do not need to be repaid.
The Department allocated $50 billion of the Provider Relief Fund for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. It allocated another $22 billion to providers in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, rural providers, and providers who serve low-income populations and uninsured Americans.  HHS will be allocating the remaining funds in the near future.
  
As part of the Provider Relief Fund distribution, all providers have 45 days to attest that they meet certain criteria to keep the funding they received, including public disclosure.  As of May 15, 2020, there has been a total of $34 billion in attested payments.  The chart only includes those providers that have attested to the payments by that date.  We will continue to update this information and add the additional providers and payments once their attestation is complete. 

CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments Program
On March 28, 2020, to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A providers and Part B suppliers. Beginning on April 26, 2020, CMS stopped accepting new applications for the Advance Payment Program, and CMS began reevaluating all pending and new applications for Accelerated Payments in light of the availability of direct payments made through HHS’s Provider Relief Fund.

Since expanding the AAP program on March 28, 2020, CMS approved over 21,000 applications totaling $59.6 billion in payments to Part A providers, which includes hospitals, through May 18, 2020. For Part B suppliers—including doctors, non-physician practitioners and durable medical equipment suppliers— during the same time period, CMS approved almost 24,000 applications advancing $40.4 billion in payments. The AAP program is not a grant, and providers and suppliers are required to repay the loan.

CMS has published AAP data, as required by the Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act of 2021, on this website: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-medicare-accelerated-and-advance-payments-program-covid-19-public-health-emergency-payment.pdf",N/A,4

94,Social Vulnerability Index,"This map shows estimates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy rates using data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey (HPS). We estimate hesitancy rates in two steps. First, we estimate hesitancy rates at the state level using the HPS for the collection period March 3, 2021 – March 15, 2021, which is referred to as Week 26. Then, we utilize the estimated values to predict hesitancy rates in more granular areas using the Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS). To create county-level estimates, we used a PUMA-to-county crosswalk from the Missouri Census Data Center. PUMAs spanning multiple counties had their estimates apportioned across those counties based on overall 2010 Census populations. 

We use the HPS survey question, “Once a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is available to you, would you…get a vaccine?”, which provides the following options: 1) “definitely get a vaccine”; 2) “probably get a vaccine”; 3) “probably not get a vaccine”; 4) “definitely not get a vaccine”. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was defined as follows: 

hesitancy: includes survey responses indicating that they would “probably not” or “definitely not” receive a COVID-19 vaccine when available.
strong hesitancy: include only survey responses indicating that they would “definitely not” receive a COVID-19 vaccine when available.
Full methodology for estimates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is available here.
Demographic data were obtained from the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates. 
 
Overall social vulnerability index was obtained from the 2018 CDC Social Vulnerability Index.  The CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) summarizes the extent to which a community is socially vulnerable to disaster. The factors considered in developing the SVI include economic data as well as data regarding education, family characteristics, housing language ability, ethnicity, and vehicle access. SVI values range from 0 (least vulnerable) to 1 (most vulnerable). The SVI can also be categorized as follows: Very Low (0.0-0.19), Low (0.20-0.39); Moderate (0.40-0.59); High (0.60-0.79); Very High (0.80-1.0).

The ability to handle a COVID-19 outbreak was obtained from the Surgo Covid-19 Vaccine Coverage Index (CVAC).  The Covid-19 Vaccine Coverage (CVAC) Index measures how well a community may be able to handle the repercussions of a COVID-19 outbreak. CVAC is based on a community's access to health care, affordable housing, transportation, childcare, or safe and secure employment. CVAC Index values range from 0 (least vulnerable) to 1 (most vulnerable). The CVAC Index can also be categorized as follows: Very Low (0.0-0.19), Low (0.20-0.39); Moderate (0.40-0.59); High (0.60-0.79); Very High (0.80-1.0).

96,NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by County: United States,"This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the county level by selected demographic characteristics and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning from 1999 to 2015.

Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).

Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.

Estimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as “Unreliable” in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.

Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.

Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3–5). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999–2015. These annual county-level estimates “borrow strength” across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo., and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies (6).",N/A,8

Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths climbed slowly from a rate of 521.0 per 100,000 in 2001 to 615.7 per 100,000 in 2005.  The rates then dipped to 595.1 per 100,000 in 2006 and 566.7 per 100,000 in 2007.  The rates then spiked sharply in 2008 and continued to climb through 2010 to a rate of 823.7 per 100,000.  Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths are driven in large part by the relatively high number of TBI-related ED visits.

102,"NSSP Emergency Department Visit Trajectories by State and Sub State Regions- COVID-19, Flu, RSV, Combined  ","NSSP Emergency Department (ED) Visit Trajectories by State and Sub-State Regions- COVID-19, Flu, RSV, Combined. This dataset provides the percentage of emergency department patient visits for the specified pathogen of all ED patient visits for the specified geographic part of the country that were observed for the given week from data submitted to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). In addition, the trend over time is characterized as increasing, decreasing or no change, with exceptions for when there are no data available, the data are too sparse, or there are not enough data to compute a trend. These data are to provide awareness of how the weekly trend is changing for the given geographic region.  

Note that the reported sub-state trends are from Health Service Areas (HSA) and the data reported from the health care facilities located within the given HSA. Health Service Areas are regions of one or more counties that align to patterns of care seeking. The HSA level data are reported for each county in the HSA. 

More information on HSAs is available <a href=""https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/countyattribs/hsa.html""><b>here</b></a>.

For the emergency department time series, trajectory classifications reported on for sub-state (HSA) emergency department time series, trajectory classifications are based on approximations of the first derivative (slope) of trends that are smoothed using generalized additive models (GAMs). To determine time intervals in which the slope is sufficiently changing (i.e., rate of change distinguishable from 0), 95% confidence intervals for the slope approximations are calculated and assessed. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval not containing 0 are classified as increasing if the slope estimate is positive and decreasing if the slope estimate is negative. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval containing 0 are classified as stable. In the scenario that an HSA's time series is determined to be too sparse (i.e., many weeks with percentages of 0%), a model is not fit, and the HSA is classified as “sparse”.

Dataset and data visualization details:


These data were posted and archived on May 30, 2023 and reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through April 22, 2023, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through April 1, 2023. These data will no longer be updated after May 2023.

Vaccination status: A person vaccinated with at least a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series ≥14 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected. A person vaccinated with a primary series and a monovalent booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably receiving a primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine and at least one additional dose of any monovalent FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. (Note: this definition does not distinguish between vaccine recipients who are immunocompromised and are receiving an additional dose versus those who are not immunocompromised and receiving a booster dose.) A person vaccinated with a primary series and an updated (bivalent) booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected in a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably receiving a primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine and an additional dose of any bivalent FDA-authorized or approved vaccine COVID-19 vaccine on or after September 1, 2022. (Note: Doses with bivalent doses reported as first or second doses are classified as vaccinated with a bivalent booster dose.) People with primary series or a monovalent booster dose were combined in the “vaccinated without an updated booster” category. 

Deaths: A COVID-19–associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Per the interim guidance of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), this should include persons whose death certificate lists COVID-19 disease or SARS-CoV-2 as the underlying cause of death or as a significant condition contributing to death. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are primarily reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19. In select jurisdictions, deaths are included that are not laboratory confirmed and are reported based on alternative dates (i.e., onset date for most; or date of death or report date, where onset date is unavailable). Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.

Participating jurisdictions: Currently, these 24 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (NY), North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia; 23 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000) after 1998 are calculated based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).

This 20-minute online survey was designed to complement the ability of the federal statistical system to rapidly respond and provide relevant information about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. Data collection began on April 23, 2020. Beginning in Phase 3.5 (on June 1, 2022), NCHS included questions about the presence of symptoms of COVID that lasted three months or longer. Phase 3.5 will continue with a two-weeks on, two-weeks off collection and dissemination approach.

Even though the data are not nationally representative, they can provide insight on the impact of COVID-19 on various types of hospitals throughout the country. This information is not available in other hospital reporting systems. The NHCS data from these hospitals can show results by a combination of indicators related to COVID-19, such as length of inpatient stay, in-hospital mortality, comorbidities, and intubation or ventilator use.

124,COVID-19 County Hesitancy,"This map shows estimates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy rates using data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey (HPS). We estimate hesitancy rates in two steps. First, we estimate hesitancy rates at the state level using the HPS for the collection period March 3, 2021 – March 15, 2021, which is referred to as Week 26. Then, we utilize the estimated values to predict hesitancy rates in more granular areas using the Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS). To create county-level estimates, we used a PUMA-to-county crosswalk from the Missouri Census Data Center. PUMAs spanning multiple counties had their estimates apportioned across those counties based on overall 2010 Census populations. 

We use the HPS survey question, “Once a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is available to you, would you…get a vaccine?”, which provides the following options: 1) “definitely get a vaccine”; 2) “probably get a vaccine”; 3) “probably not get a vaccine”; 4) “definitely not get a vaccine”. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was defined as follows: 

hesitancy: includes survey responses indicating that they would “probably not” or “definitely not” receive a COVID-19 vaccine when available.
strong hesitancy: include only survey responses indicating that they would “definitely not” receive a COVID-19 vaccine when available.
Full methodology for estimates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is available here.
Demographic data were obtained from the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates. 
 
Overall social vulnerability index was obtained from the 2018 CDC Social Vulnerability Index.  The CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) summarizes the extent to which a community is socially vulnerable to disaster. The factors considered in developing the SVI include economic data as well as data regarding education, family characteristics, housing language ability, ethnicity, and vehicle access. SVI values range from 0 (least vulnerable) to 1 (most vulnerable). The SVI can also be categorized as follows: Very Low (0.0-0.19), Low (0.20-0.39); Moderate (0.40-0.59); High (0.60-0.79); Very High (0.80-1.0).

The ability to handle a COVID-19 outbreak was obtained from the Surgo Covid-19 Vaccine Coverage Index (CVAC).  The Covid-19 Vaccine Coverage (CVAC) Index measures how well a community may be able to handle the repercussions of a COVID-19 outbreak. CVAC is based on a community's access to health care, affordable housing, transportation, childcare, or safe and secure employment. CVAC Index values range from 0 (least vulnerable) to 1 (most vulnerable). The CVAC Index can also be categorized as follows: Very Low (0.0-0.19), Low (0.20-0.39); Moderate (0.40-0.59); High (0.60-0.79); Very High (0.80-1.0).

The percent of adults (18+) in the population who are fully vaccinated was obtained from the CDC COVID-19 Data Tracker, Integrated County View as of March 30, 2021.

Dataset and data visualization details:
These data were posted on October 21, 2022, archived on November 18, 2022, and revised on February 22, 2023. These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. 

Vaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series ≥14 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.
Additional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.
** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.
Deaths: A COVID-19–associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.
Participating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

149,Weekly Rates of Laboratory-Confirmed RSV Hospitalizations from the RSV-NET Surveillance System,"The Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET) is a network that conducts active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated hospitalizations in children younger than 18 years of age and adults. RSV-NET, along with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) an the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance network (FluSuv-NET), comprise the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET).  The RESP-NET platforms have overlapping surveillance areas and use similar methods to collect data. Because the surveillance areas and age groups included in surveillance have changed over time, trends should be interpreted with caution. RSV-NET is CDC’s source for important data on rates of hospitalizations associated with RSV. Hospitalization rates show how many people in the surveillance area are hospitalized with RSV, compared to the total number of people residing in that area.

159,NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by State: United States,"This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the U.S. and state level by selected demographic characteristics, and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning. 

Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).

Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.

Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.

161,Air Quality Measures on the National Environmental Health Tracking Network,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides air pollution data about ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) to CDC for the Tracking Network. The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the ""gold standard"" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This data does not include ""Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor PM2.5)"".

The program funding information is as follows: The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (P.L. 116-136), appropriated $100 billion to reimburse eligible health care providers for health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus. The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act or PPPHCEA (P.L. 116-139) appropriated an additional $75 billion for relief funds, and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act appropriated an additional $3 billion.  HRSA established the Provider Relief Fund (PRF) to administer payments to eligible providers. A portion of the PRF funds are being used to provide reimbursement to providers for administering Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized COVID-19 vaccines under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or FDA-licensed COVID-19 vaccines under a Biologics License Application (BLA) to underinsured individuals. To learn more about the program, visit: https://www.hrsa.gov/covid19-coverage-assistance

To support state and local communication and outreach efforts, ASPE developed state, county, and sub-state level predictions of hesitancy rates(https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/vaccine-hesitancy) using the most recently available federal survey data.

We estimate hesitancy rates at the state level using the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey (HPS)(https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html) data and utilize the estimated values to predict hesitancy rates in more granular areas using the Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS)(https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html). Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMA) level – PUMAs are geographic areas within each state that contain no fewer than 100,000 people. PUMAs can consist of part of a single densely populated county or can combine parts or all of multiple counties that are less densely populated.

The HPS is nationally representative and includes information on U.S. residents’ intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine when available, as well as other sociodemographic and geographic (state, region and metropolitan statistical areas) information. The ACS is a nationally representative survey, and it provides key sociodemographic and geographic (state, region, PUMAs, county) information. We utilized data for the survey collection period May 26, 2021 – June 7, 2021, which the HPS refers to as Week 31.

United States death counts and rates include the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.

Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1. Number of deaths reported in this file are the total number of COVID-19 deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and may not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Counts of deaths occurring before or after the reporting period are not included in the file.

Data during recent periods are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.

Death counts should not be compared across jurisdictions. Data timeliness varies by state. Some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly.

The ten (10) United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New Jersey, New York; Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.

Rates were calculated using the population estimates for 2021, which are estimated as of July 1, 2021 based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census PL 94-171 Redistricting File (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/methods-statement-v2021.pdf).

Rate are based on deaths occurring in the specified week and are age-adjusted to the 2000 standard population using the direct method (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-08-508.pdf). These rates differ from annual age-adjusted rates, typically presented in NCHS publications based on a full year of data and annualized weekly age-adjusted rates which have been adjusted to allow comparison with annual rates. Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly) rate prevailed for a full year.

Sub-national death counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS data confidentiality standards. Rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS standards of reliability as specified in NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions (available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdf.).",N/A,13

190,"Percent Positivity of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests by HHS Region, National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System","More than 450 public health, clinical, and commercial laboratories located throughout the United States voluntarily participate in surveillance for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) through CDC's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/labs/index.html). The data contain weekly, aggregate counts of RSV tests performed and RSV detections as reported to NREVSS since April 11, 2020. 

NREVSS data are reported weekly at the national and 10 HHS regional levels (https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/regional-offices/index.html). The presented data are RSV Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) results, which include reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. These data exclude antigen, antibody, and at-home test results. Less than 5% of RSV tests reported to NREVSS are from antigen tests. All data are provisional and subject to change. Reporting is less complete for the most recent weeks, but relatively complete (>90%) for the period up to 2 weeks earlier. 

Percent positivity is a surveillance metric used to monitor RSV activity over time and by geographic area. Participating laboratories send weekly reports of the total number of RSV tests performed that week, and the number of those tests that were positive. In the table and upon hovering on the map, the total test counts reflect the latest data reported to NREVSS and may differ from data presented by public health jurisdictions. Public health jurisdictions may have additional data not reported to NREVSS and may use a different reporting cadence. The RSV trend graphs display the weekly average percent of tests positive for RSV among all the tests performed. Each point on the regional table displays the average number of RSV tests that were performed, and the average percent of those that were positive during a 3-week period (i.e., the specified week, and the weeks immediately preceding and following it). This is also known as a centered, 3-week moving average. The RSV detections displayed are the 5-week moving average (average of the 4 previous and current weeks) in accordance with the recommendations for assessing RSV trends by detections (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/216/3/345/3860464). 

NREVSS strives to present precise estimates of respiratory viral trends and minimize reporting burden for participating laboratories. However, there are several limitations to this surveillance system. NREVSS is a laboratory-based surveillance system that does not have patient-specific data; multiple tests from a single patient may be included. In addition, NREVSS does not collect demographic or clinical data (i.e., hospitalizations or deaths). Testing practices may vary regionally, and the number of participating laboratories may change from year to year. Laboratories from all 50 states report data weekly, but reporting is voluntary and may not be representative of local RSV activity. The data do not include all test results within a jurisdiction and therefore do not reflect all RSV NAATs administered regionally or nationally. Participating laboratories vary in size, testing capabilities, and areas and populations served. Geographic results from clinical laboratories are based on testing location and laboratories may test samples from across one or more states.

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. 

Case counts in these tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. 

“Symbols and footnotes changed in week #4, please refer to the MMWR publication for the symbols/footnotes for weeks 1, 2, and 3”.

192,NCHS - Childhood Mortality Rates,"This dataset of U.S. mortality trends since 1900 highlights childhood mortality rates by age group for age at death.

Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000) after 1998 are calculated based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).

Age groups for childhood death rates are based on age at death.

193,NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by State: United States,"This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the U.S. and state level by selected demographic characteristics, and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning from 1999 to 2015.

Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).

Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.

Estimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as “Unreliable” in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.

Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.

Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3–5). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999–2015. These annual county-level estimates “borrow strength” across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo., and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies (6).",N/A,18
194,NCHS - U.S. and State Trends on Teen Births,"This dataset assembles all final birth data for females aged 15–19, 15–17, and 18–19 for the United States and each of the 50 states.

Data are based on 100% of birth certificates filed in all 50 states. All the teen birth rates in this dashboard reflect the latest revisions to Census populations (i.e., the intercensal populations) and thus provide a consistent series of accurate rates for the past 25 years. The denominators of the teen birth rates for 1991–1999 have been revised to incorporate the results of the 2000 Census. The denominators of the teen birth rates for 2001–2009 have revised to incorporate the results of the 2010 Census.",N/A,8
195,NCHS - Injury Mortality: United States,"This dataset describes injury mortality in the United States beginning in 1999. Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2). 

Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.

Causes of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality matrix (1,2). Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.

PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. Project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2022 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2018–2022 estimates. The 2024 release uses 2022 BRFSS data for 36 measures and 2021 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening, and taking medicine for high blood pressure control among those with high blood pressure) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census 2022 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 40 measures at the county level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software. https://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7",N/A,168
200,"Percent Positivity of COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests by HHS Region, National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System","More than 450 public health and clinical laboratories located throughout the United States participate in surveillance for severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, through CDC's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). The dataset contains a weekly summary of aggregate counts of the total SARS-CoV-2 tests and SARS-CoV-2 detections reported to NREVSS since March 14, 2020. These data are reported weekly on a voluntary basis. Clinical laboratories do not report demographic data through NREVSS. Testing practices may vary regionally, and the number of participating laboratories may change from year to year. Results can be changed for up to 2 years after the initial reporting week. However, discrepancies may be noted and updated at the discretion of the data stewards and key stakeholders.

While NREVSS strives to present the most precise estimates of respiratory viral trends with reporting burden minimized for participating laboratories, there are several inherent limitations to this surveillance system.

NREVSS does not collect patient-specific data or demographic information. Multiple samples may be collected from a single patient, so NREVSS results do not necessarily reflect the number of patients tested, nor do they directly reflect hospitalizations or deaths related to COVID-19.

Participating laboratories vary in size, testing capabilities, and areas served. Some institutions may receive and test samples from sites across a given state or even from multiple states. Without direct knowledge of the population base, NREVSS cannot be used to determine the prevalence or incidence of infection.

For more information on NREVSS and COVID-19 surveillance please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss. These data appear starting May 25, 2023 on the CDC COVID Data Tracker at the following URLs: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends ; https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases.   

NREVSS data are reported at the national and HHS regional levels. The ten (10) U.S. Department of HHS regions are defined here: https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/regional-offices/index.html. 

The data represent SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) results, which include reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests from a voluntary, sentinel network of participating laboratories in the United States, including clinical, public health and commercial laboratories (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/labs/index.html). 

These data exclude antigen, antibody, and at-home test results. 

All data are provisional and subject to change. Reporting is less complete for the past 1 week, and more complete (>90%) for the period 2 weeks earlier. 

There are data from all states across the 10 HHS regions. Because the data are from a sentinel network of laboratories, however, results may vary geographically. The data do not include all test results within a jurisdiction and therefore do not reflect all SARS-CoV-2 NAATs administered in the United States. 

Percent positivity is one of the surveillance metrics used to monitor COVID-19 transmission over time and by area. Percent positivity is calculated by dividing the number of positive NAATs by the total number of NAATs administered, then multiplying by 100 [(# of positive NAAT tests / total NAAT tests) x 100].

The data represent laboratory tests performed, not individual (deduplicated) results in people. In the table and upon hovering on the map, the total test counts in the data reflect the latest data reported from NREVSS laboratories and may not match the data presented by various jurisdictions.

On May 11, 2023, CDC discontinued utilizing the COVID electronic laboratory reporting (CELR) platform as the primary laboratory source of COVID-19 results. These data are archived at health.data.gov.

Estimates for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications noted previously (7,8).

207,2022 Final Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Success Rates,"ART data are made available as part of the National ART Surveillance System (NASS) that collects success rates, services, profiles and annual summary data from fertility clinics across the U.S. There are four datasets available: ART Services and Profiles, ART Patient and Cycle Characteristics, ART Success Rates, and ART Summary. All four datasets may be linked by “ClinicID.” ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Success Rates dataset contains success rates for ART cycles started during the year indicated. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using their own eggs or donor eggs, success rates are included separately for these two groups. Success rates for patients using their own eggs are shown per intended retrieval, per actual retrieval, and per transfer. These success rates are reported as cumulative success rates, which take into account transfers that occur within 1 year after an egg retrieval. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using ART for the first time or had prior ART cycles, users can examine success rates for all “Patients using their own eggs” or for “Patients with no prior ART using their own eggs.” For new patients using ART for the first time, the success rates are also shown after 1, 2, or all intended egg retrievals during the reporting year. In addition, the average number of transfers per intended retrieval and the average number of intended retrievals per live-birth delivery are shown. Success rates for ART cycles that involve the transfer of embryos created from donor eggs or donated embryos are shown and are not cumulative. They are based on donor cycles started in the year indicated that had embryo transfers, regardless of when the donor eggs were retrieved. Success rates in this section are not presented by patient age group because previous data show that an intended parent’s age does not substantially affect success when using donor eggs or donated embryos. The success rates are presented by types of embryos and eggs used in the transfer. This dataset excludes cycles that were considered research—that is, cycles performed to evaluate new procedures.",N/A,29

213,1998-2023 Serotype Data for Invasive Pneumococcal Disease Cases by Age Group from Active Bacterial Core surveillance,"CDC monitors invasive bacterial infections that cause bloodstream infections, sepsis, and meningitis in persons living in the community through Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs). ABCs conducts laboratory- and population-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). ABCs serotype data are used to measure the impact of vaccine use in the United States on vaccine-type IPD. 

This table reports IPD case counts in the ABCs catchment area by serotype for years 1998 through 2022. Cases are grouped into the following mutually exclusive age groups: age <2 years old, age 2–4 years old, age 5–17 years old, age 18–49 years old, age 50–64 years old, and age ≥65 years old.

ABCs methods and surveillance areas reporting IPD cases has changed over time. Given these changes, trends in serotype distribution by year and age group should be interpreted with caution.

214,"Provisional COVID-19 death counts and rates, by jurisdiction of residence and demographic characteristics","This file contains COVID-19 death counts and rates by jurisdiction of residence (U.S., HHS Region) and demographic characteristics (sex, age, race and Hispanic origin, and age/race and Hispanic origin). United States death counts and rates include the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia. 

Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1. Number of deaths reported in this file are the total number of COVID-19 deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and may not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Counts of deaths occurring before or after the reporting period are not included in the file.

Data during recent periods are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.

Death counts should not be compared across jurisdictions. Data timeliness varies by state. Some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly. 

The ten (10) United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New Jersey, New York; Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.

Rates were calculated using the population estimates for 2021, which are estimated as of July 1, 2021 based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census PL 94-171 Redistricting File (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/methods-statement-v2021.pdf).

Rate are based on deaths occurring in the specified week and are age-adjusted to the 2000 standard population using the direct method (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-08-508.pdf). These rates differ from annual age-adjusted rates, typically presented in NCHS publications based on a full year of data and annualized weekly age-adjusted rates which have been adjusted to allow comparison with annual rates. Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly) rate prevailed for a full year.

217,VSRR Provisional County-Level Drug Overdose Death Counts,"This data visualization presents county-level provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. County-level provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts (see Technical Notes).

The provisional data presented on the dashboard below include reported 12 month-ending provisional counts of death due to drug overdose by the decedent’s county of residence and the month in which death occurred.

Percentages of deaths with a cause of death pending further investigation and a note on historical completeness (e.g. if the percent completeness was under 90% after 6 months) are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical Notes). Counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS confidentiality standards. Provisional data presented on this page will be updated on a quarterly basis as additional records are received.

Technical Notes

Nature and Sources of Data

Provisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from the state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).

The timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death and jurisdiction in which the death occurred. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death due to the time often needed to investigate these deaths (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.

Provisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for “12 month-ending periods,” defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12 month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12 month-ending period in June 2020 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. The 12 month-ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12 month-ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation.

Cause of Death Classification and Definition of Drug Deaths

Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with the World Health Organizations (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regul",N/A,17

223,Access and Use of Telemedicine During COVID-19,"The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is a platform designed for conducting survey question evaluation and statistical research. RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS’ higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of telemedicine access and use for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included questions about whether providers offered telemedicine (including video and telephone appointments) in the last 2 months—both during and before the pandemic—and about the use of telemedicine in the last 2 months during the pandemic. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, many local and state governments discouraged people from leaving their homes for nonessential reasons. Although health care is considered an essential activity, telemedicine offers an opportunity for care without the potential or perceived risks of leaving the home. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, added telemedicine questions to its sample adult questionnaire in July 2020.  The Household Pulse Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/telemedicine-use.htm), an online survey conducted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Census Bureau in partnership with other federal agencies including NCHS, also reports estimates of telemedicine use during the pandemic (beginning in Phase 3.1, which started on April 14, 2021). The Household Pulse Survey reports telemedicine use in the last 4 weeks among adults and among households with at least one child under age 18 years. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who have a usual place of care and a provider that offered telemedicine in the past 2 months, who used telemedicine in the past 2 months, or who have a usual place of care and a provider that offered telemedicine prior to the coronavirus pandemic.

225,NCHS - Teen Birth Rates for Age Group 15-19 in the United States by County,"This data set contains estimated teen birth rates for age group 15–19 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15–19) by county and year.

DEFINITIONS

Estimated teen birth rate: Model-based estimates of teen birth rates for age group 15–19 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15–19) for a specific county and year. Estimated county teen birth rates were obtained using the methods described elsewhere (1,2,3,4). These annual county-level teen birth estimates “borrow strength” across counties and years to generate accurate estimates where data are sparse due to small population size (1,2,3,4). The inferential method uses information—including the estimated teen birth rates from neighboring counties across years and the associated explanatory variables—to provide a stable estimate of the county teen birth rate.
Median teen birth rate: The middle value of the estimated teen birth rates for the age group 15–19 for counties in a state.
Bayesian credible intervals: A range of values within which there is a 95% probability that the actual teen birth rate will fall, based on the observed teen births data and the model.

NOTES

Data on the number of live births for women aged 15–19 years were extracted from the National Center for Health Statistics’ (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System birth data files for 2003–2015 (5).

Population estimates were extracted from the files containing intercensal and postcensal bridged-race population estimates provided by NCHS. For each year, the July population estimates were used, with the exception of the year of the decennial census, 2010, for which the April estimates were used.

Hierarchical Bayesian space–time models were used to generate hierarchical Bayesian estimates of county teen birth rates for each year during 2003–2015 (1,2,3,4).

The Bayesian analogue of the frequentist confidence interval is defined as the Bayesian credible interval. A 100*(1-α)% Bayesian credible interval for an unknown parameter vector θ and observed data vector y is a subset C of parameter space Ф such that
1-α≤P({C│y})=∫p{θ │y}dθ,
where integration is performed over the set  and is replaced by summation for discrete components of θ.  The probability that θ lies in C given the observed data y is at least (1- α) (6).

County borders in Alaska changed, and new counties were formed and others were merged, during 2003–2015. These changes were reflected in the population files but not in the natality files. For this reason, two counties in Alaska were collapsed so that the birth and population counts were comparable. Additionally, Kalawao County, a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and 19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason, Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia, was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County, Virginia, for the entire 2003–2015 period. Final analysis was conducted on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005–2007 bridged-race population file geographies (7).",N/A,9

227,NCHS - Potentially Excess Deaths from the Five Leading Causes of Death,"MMWR Surveillance Summary 66 (No. SS-1):1-8 found that nonmetropolitan areas have significant numbers of potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes of death. These figures accompany this report by presenting information on potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas at the state level. They also add additional years of data and options for selecting different age ranges and benchmarks.

Potentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states. They are calculated by subtracting expected deaths for specific benchmarks from observed deaths.

Not all potentially excess deaths can be prevented; some areas might have characteristics that predispose them to higher rates of death. However, many potentially excess deaths might represent deaths that could be prevented through improved public health programs that support healthier behaviors and neighborhoods or better access to health care services.

Mortality data for U.S. residents come from the National Vital Statistics System. Estimates based on fewer than 10 observed deaths are not shown and shaded yellow on the map.

Underlying cause of death is based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10)

Heart disease (I00-I09, I11, I13, and I20–I51)
Cancer (C00–C97)
Unintentional injury (V01–X59 and Y85–Y86)
Chronic lower respiratory disease (J40–J47)
Stroke (I60–I69)
Locality (nonmetropolitan vs. metropolitan) is based on the Office of Management and Budget’s 2013 county-based classification scheme.

Benchmarks are based on the three states with the lowest age and cause-specific mortality rates.

Potentially excess deaths for each state are calculated by subtracting deaths at the benchmark rates (expected deaths) from observed deaths.

Users can explore three benchmarks:

“2010 Fixed” is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2010.
“2005 Fixed” is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2005.
“Floating” is based on the best performing States in each year so change from year to year.

<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>
The County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down"">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making. 

<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>
<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> ""New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days"" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. ""New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days"" is considered to have transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00). 

<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> ""Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days"" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests resulted over the last 7 days. ""Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days"" is considered to have transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00). 


The data in this dataset are considered provisional by CDC and are subject to change until the data are reconciled and verified with the state and territorial data providers.

Provisional rates which are an early estimate of the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, are shown as of the date specified and may not include all deaths and births that occurred during a given time period (see Technical Notes).

A maternal death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes. In this data visualization, maternal deaths are those deaths with an underlying cause of death assigned to International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code numbers A34, O00–O95, and O98–O99.

The provisional data  include reported 12 month-ending provisional maternal mortality rates overall, by age, and by race and Hispanic origin. Provisional maternal mortality rates presented in this data visualization are for “12-month ending periods,” defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2020 would include deaths and births occurring from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020. Evaluation of trends over time should compare estimates from year to year (June 2020 and June 2021), rather than month to month, to avoid overlapping time periods.

284,Telemedicine Use in the Last 4 Weeks,"To rapidly monitor recent changes in the use of telemedicine, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Maternal and Child Health Bureau (HRSA MCHB) partnered with the Census Bureau on an experimental data system called the Household Pulse Survey. This 20-minute online survey was designed to complement the ability of the federal statistical system to rapidly respond and provide relevant information about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.

The U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with five federal agencies, launched the Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on American households.  The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.

The survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions.",N/A,15

The NIS-ACM provides data on Influenza (flu), COVID-19, and RSV vaccination for adults aged ≥18 years in the United States. The NIS-CCM provides data on COVID-19 vaccination for children aged 6 months-17 years in the United States. The NIS-Flu provides data on Influenza vaccination for children aged 6 months-17 years in the United States National Immunization Survey data are collected by telephone interview using a random-digit-dialed sample of cellular telephone numbers stratified by state, the District of Columbia, five local jurisdictions (Bexar County TX, Chicago IL, Houston TX, New York City NY, and Philadelphia County PA), and Guam, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. Data are weighted to represent the non-institutionalized United States population and mitigate possible bias that can result from incomplete sample frame (exclusion of households with no phone service or only landline telephones) or non-response. All responses are self-reported, or reported by a parent for children 6 months-17 years.

303,"Early Model-based Provisional Estimates of Drug Overdose, Suicide, and Transportation-related Deaths","This dataset provides model-based provisional estimates of the weekly numbers of drug overdose, suicide, and transportation-related deaths using “nowcasting” methods to account for the normal lag between the occurrence and reporting of these deaths. Estimates less than 10 are suppressed. These early model-based provisional estimates were generated using a multi-stage hierarchical Bayesian modeling process to generate smoothed estimates of the weekly numbers of death, accounting for reporting lags. These estimates are based on several assumptions about how the reporting lags have changed in recent months across different jurisdictions, and the resulting estimates differ from other sources of provisional mortality data.  For now, these estimates should be considered highly uncertain until further evaluations can be done to determine the validity of these assumptions about timeliness. The true patterns in reporting lags will not be known until data are finalized, typically 11–12 months after the end of the calendar year. Importantly, these estimates are not a replacement for monthly provisional drug overdose death counts, or quarterly provisional mortality estimates.

Information on outpatient visits to health care providers for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness (ILI) is collected through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). ILINet consists of outpatient healthcare providers in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. More than 100 million patient visits were reported during the 2022-23 season. Each week, more than 3,000 outpatient health care providers around the country report to CDC the number of patient visits for ILI by age group (0-4 years, 5-24 years, 25-49 years, 50-64 years, and ≥65 years) and the total number of visits for any reason. A subset of providers also reports total visits by age group. For this system, ILI is defined as fever (temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or greater) and a cough and/or a sore throat. Activity levels are based on the percent of outpatient visits due to ILI in a jurisdiction compared to the average percent of ILI visits that occur during weeks with little or no influenza virus circulation (non-influenza weeks) in that jurisdiction. The number of sites reporting each week is variable; therefore, baselines are adjusted each week based on which sites within each jurisdiction provide data. To perform this adjustment, provider level baseline ILI ratios are calculated for those that have a sufficient reporting history. Providers that do not have the required reporting history to calculate a provider-specific baseline are assigned the baseline ratio for their practice type. The jurisdiction level baseline is then calculated using a weighted sum of the baseline ratios for each contributing provider. 

The activity levels compare the mean reported percent of visits due to ILI during the current week to the mean reported percent of visits due to ILI during non-influenza weeks. The 13 activity levels correspond to the number of standard deviations below, at, or above the mean for the current week compared with the mean during non-influenza weeks. Activity levels are classified as minimal (levels 1-3), low (levels 4-5), moderate (levels 6-7), high (levels 8-10), and very high (levels 11-13). An activity level of 1 corresponds to an ILI percentage below the mean, level 2 corresponds to an ILI percentage less than 1 standard deviation above the mean, level 3 corresponds to an ILI percentage more than 1 but less than 2 standard deviations above the mean, and so on, with an activity level of 10 corresponding to an ILI percentage 8 to 11 standard deviations above the mean. The very high levels correspond to an ILI percentage 12 to 15 standard deviations above the mean for level 11, 16 to 19 standard deviations above the mean for level 12, and 20 or more standard deviations above the mean for level 13. 

Disclaimers: 

The ILI Activity Indicator map reflects the intensity of ILI activity, not the extent of geographic spread of ILI, within a jurisdiction. Therefore, outbreaks occurring in a single area could cause the entire jurisdiction to display high or very high activity levels. In addition, data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a jurisdiction, and therefore, may not accurately depict the full picture of respiratory illness activity for the entire jurisdiction. Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with data presented by the health department likely being more complete.

332,Loss of Work Due to Illness from COVID-19,"The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is a platform designed for conducting survey question evaluation and statistical research. RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS’ higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of loss of work due to illness with coronavirus for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included a question about the inability to work due to being sick or having a family member sick with COVID-19. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor work-loss days and work limitations in the United States. For example, in 2018, 42.7% of adults aged 18 and over missed at least 1 day of work in the previous year due to illness or injury and 9.3% of adults aged 18 to 69 were limited in their ability to work or unable to work due to physical, mental, or emotional problems. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who did not work for pay at a job or business, at any point, in the previous week because either they or someone in their family was sick with COVID-19.

355,Reduced Access to Care During COVID-19,"The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is a platform designed for conducting survey question evaluation and statistical research. RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS’ higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of reduced access to healthcare for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included questions about unmet care in the last 2 months during the coronavirus pandemic. Unmet needs for health care are often the result of cost-related barriers. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor cost-related health care access problems in the United States. For example, in 2018, 7.3% of persons of all ages reported delaying medical care due to cost and 4.8% reported needing medical care but not getting it due to cost in the past year. However, cost is not the only reason someone might delay or not receive needed medical care. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, people also may not get needed medical care due to cancelled appointments, cutbacks in transportation options, fear of going to the emergency room, or an altruistic desire to not be a burden on the health care system, among other reasons. The Household Pulse Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/reduced-access-to-care.htm), an online survey conducted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Census Bureau in partnership with other federal agencies including NCHS, also reports estimates of reduced access to care during the pandemic (beginning in Phase 1, which started on April 23, 2020). The Household Pulse Survey reports the percentage of adults who delayed medical care in the last 4 weeks or who needed medical care at any time in the last 4 weeks for something other than coronavirus but did not get it because of the pandemic. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who were unable to receive medical care (including urgent care, surgery, screening tests, ongoing treatment, regular checkups, prescriptions, dental care, vision care, and hearing care) in the last 2 months.

365,"NCHS - Teen Birth Rates for Females by Age Group, Race, and Hispanic Origin: United States","This dataset includes teen birth rates for females by age group, race, and Hispanic origin in the United States since 1960. 

Data availability varies by race and ethnicity groups. All birth data by race before 1980 are based on race of the child. Since 1980, birth data by race are based on race of the mother. For race, data are available for Black and White births since 1960, and for American Indians/Alaska Native and Asian/Pacific Islander births since 1980. Data on Hispanic origin are available since 1989. Teen birth rates for specific racial and ethnic categories are also available since 1989. From 2003 through 2015, the birth data by race were based on the “bridged” race categories (5). Starting in 2016, the race categories for reporting birth data changed; the new race and Hispanic origin categories are: Non-Hispanic, Single Race White; Non-Hispanic, Single Race Black; Non-Hispanic, Single Race American Indian/Alaska Native; Non-Hispanic, Single Race Asian; and, Non-Hispanic, Single Race Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (5,6). Birth data by the prior, “bridged” race (and Hispanic origin) categories are included through 2018 for comparison.

National data on births by Hispanic origin exclude data for Louisiana, New Hampshire, and Oklahoma in 1989; New Hampshire and Oklahoma in 1990; and New Hampshire in 1991 and 1992. Birth and fertility rates for the Central and South American population includes other and unknown Hispanic.

411,NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by State: United States,"This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the U.S. and state level by selected demographic characteristics, and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning. 

Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).

Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.

Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.

414,Weekly United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by County - ARCHIVED,"<b>Note:</b> 
The cumulative case count for some counties (with small population) is higher than expected due to the inclusion of non-permanent residents in COVID-19 case counts. 

Reporting of Aggregate Case and Death Count data was discontinued on May 11, 2023, with the expiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration. Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.

<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, data were reported through a robust process with the following steps:</b><ul><li>Aggregate county-level counts were obtained indirectly, via automated overnight web collection, or directly, via a data submission process.</li><li>If more than one official county data source existed, CDC used a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source to retrieve the highest case and death counts, unless otherwise specified by the state.</li><li>A CDC data team reviewed counts for congruency prior to integration. CDC routinely compiled these data and post the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker.</li><li>Cases and deaths are based on date of report and not on the date of symptom onset. CDC calculates rates in this data by using population estimates provided by the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program (2019 Vintage).</li><li>COVID-19 aggregate case and death data were organized in a time series that includes cumulative number of cases and deaths as reported by a jurisdiction on a given date.  New case and death counts were calculated as the week-to-week change in reported cumulative cases and deaths (i.e., newly reported cases and deaths = cumulative number of cases/deaths reported this week minus the cumulative total reported the week before.</li></ul>

This process was collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provided the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. Throughout data collection, CDC retrospectively updated counts to correct known data quality issues. CDC also worked with jurisdictions after the end of the public health emergency declaration to finalize county data. 
<ul><li><b>Source:</b> The weekly archived dataset is based on county-level aggregate count data</li><li><b>Confirmed/Probable Cases/Death breakdown:</b> Cumulative cases and deaths for each county are included.  Total reported cases include probable and confirmed cases.</li><li><b>Time Series Frequency:</b> The weekly archived dataset contains weekly time series data (i.e., one record per week per county)</li></ul>
 
<b>Important note:</b> The counts reflected during a given time period in this dataset may not match the counts reflected for the same time period in the daily archived dataset noted above. Discrepancies may exist due to differences between county and state COVID-19 case surveillance and reconciliation efforts.

The surveillance case definition for COVID-19, a nationally notifiable disease, was first described in a <a href=""https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/"">position statement</a> from the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, which was later <a href=""https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/"">revised</a>.

In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.

Note:
These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. 

Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.

The weekly COVID-19-associated burden estimates are preliminary and based on continuously collected surveillance data from patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. The data come from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), a surveillance platform that captures data from hospitals that serve about 10% of the U.S. population. Each week CDC estimates a range (i.e., lower estimate and an upper estimate) of COVID-19 -associated burden that have occurred since October 1, 2024. 

<b>Note:</b> Data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Rates for recent COVID-19-associated hospital admissions are subject to reporting delays; as new data are received each week, previous rates are updated accordingly.

427,Respiratory Syncytial Virus Laboratory Data (NREVSS),"Approximately 600 public health and clinical laboratories located throughout the United States, participate in surveillance for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) through CDC's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). The dataset contains a weekly summary of the total RSV tests and RSV detections reported to NREVSS. These data are reported on a voluntary basis. Clinical laboratories do not report demographic data through NREVSS. Testing practices and the number of participating laboratories may change from year to year. Results can be changed two years after the initial reporting week. However, discrepancies may be noted and updated at the discretion of the data stewards and key stakeholders.

Data are collected from collaborating university and community hospital laboratories, select states and county public health laboratories, and commercial laboratories. This information is submitted and updated on a weekly basis. 

While NREVSS strives to present the most precise national, regional and state respiratory viral trends with the least amount of burden possible for participating laboratories, there are a number of inherent limitations to this surveillance system. 

NREVSS does not collect patient-data or demographic information. Multiple samples may be collected from a single patient, so NREVSS results do not necessarily reflect the number of patients tested nor does it reflect hospitalizations or deaths related to a particular virus. 

Participating laboratories vary in size, testing capabilities, and areas served. Some institutions may receive and test samples from sites across a given state or even from multiple states. Without direct knowledge of the population base, NREVSS cannot be used to determine the prevalence or incidence of infection.

This is the largest nationwide COVID-19 seroprevalence survey to date. De-identified blood samples are tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the percentage of people in the United States who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and to track how this percentage changes over time. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines currently used in the United States result in production of anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies but only infection results in production of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies. Infection-induced seroprevalence estimates the proportion of the population with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and refers to the prevalence of the population with both anti-S and anti-N antibodies.

443,Healthy People 2020 Final Progress Table,"[1] Status is determined using the baseline, final, and target value. The statuses used in Healthy People 2020 were: 

1 - Target met or exceeded—One of the following applies: (i) At baseline, the target was not met or exceeded, and the most recent value was equal to or exceeded the target. (The percentage of targeted change achieved was equal to or greater than 100%.); (ii) The baseline and most recent values were equal to or exceeded the target. (The percentage of targeted change achieved was not assessed.) 

2 - Improved—One of the following applies: (i) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were available, and the percentage of targeted change achieved was statistically significant; (ii) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had achieved 10% or more of the targeted change.

3 - Little or no detectable change—One of the following applies: (i) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were available, and the percentage of targeted change achieved was not statistically significant; (ii) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had achieved less than 10% of the targeted change; (iii) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were available, and the percent change relative to the baseline was not statistically significant; (iv) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had moved less than 10% relative to the baseline; (v) No change was observed between the baseline and the final data point.

4 - Got worse—One of the following applies: (i) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were available, and the percent change relative to the baseline was statistically significant; (ii) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had moved 10% or more relative to the baseline.

5 - Baseline only—The objective only had one data point, so progress toward target attainment could not be assessed. Note that if additional data points did not meet the criteria for statistical reliability, data quality, or confidentiality, the objective was categorized as baseline only. 

6 - Informational—A target was not set for this objective, so progress toward target attainment could not be assessed.


[2] The final value is generally based on data available on the Healthy People 2020 website as of January 2020. For objectives that are continuing into Healthy People 2030, more recent data are available on the Healthy People 2030 website: https://health.gov/healthypeople. 


[3] For objectives that moved toward their targets, movement toward the target was measured as the percentage of targeted change achieved (unless the target was already met or exceeded at baseline): 

Percentage of targeted change achieved = (Final value - Baseline value) / (HP2020 target - Baseline value) * 100


[4] For objectives that were not improving, did not meet or exceed their targets, and did not move towards their targets, movement away from the baseline was measured as the magnitude of the percent change from baseline: 

Magnitude of percent change from baseline = |Final value - Baseline value| / Baseline value * 100


[5] Statistical significance was tested when the objective had a target, at least two data points (of unequal value), and available standard errors of the data. A normal distribution was assumed. All available digits were used to test statistical significance. Statistical significance of the percentage of targeted change achieved or the magnitude of the percentage change from baseline was assessed at the 0.05 level using a normal one-sided test.

This dataset includes 2013, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013, 2010-2014 estimates. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/500cities.
Note: During the process of uploading the 2015 estimates, CDC found a data discrepancy in the published 500 Cities data for the 2014 city-level obesity crude prevalence estimates caused when reformatting the SAS data file to the open data format. . The small area estimation model and code were correct. This data discrepancy only affected the 2014 city-level obesity crude prevalence estimates on the Socrata open data file, the GIS-friendly data file, and the 500 Cities online application. The other obesity estimates (city-level age-adjusted and tract-level) and the Mapbooks were not affected. No other measures were affected. The correct estimates are update in this dataset on October 25, 2017.",N/A,28

448,Healthy People 2020 Final Progress by Population Group Chart and Table,"[1] The Progress by Population Group analysis is a component of the Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) Final Review. The analysis included subsets of the 1,111 measurable HP2020 objectives that have data available for any of six broad population characteristics: sex, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, family income, disability status, and geographic location. Progress toward meeting HP2020 targets is presented for up to 24 population groups within these characteristics, based on objective data aggregated across HP2020 topic areas. The Progress by Population Group data are also available at the individual objective level in the downloadable data set. 
[2] The final value was generally based on data available on the HP2020 website as of January 2020. For objectives that are continuing into HP2030, more recent data will be included on the HP2030 website as it becomes available: https://health.gov/healthypeople.

[4] Status for objectives included in the HP2020 Progress by Population Group analysis was determined using the baseline, final, and target value. The progress status categories used in HP2020 were:

a. Target met or exceeded—One of the following applies: (i) At baseline, the target was not met or exceeded, and the most recent value was equal to or exceeded the target (the percentage of targeted change achieved was equal to or greater than 100%); (ii) The baseline and most recent values were equal to or exceeded the target (the percentage of targeted change achieved was not assessed). 

b. Improved—One of the following applies: (i) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were available, and the percentage of targeted change achieved was statistically significant; (ii) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had achieved 10% or more of the targeted change.

c. Little or no detectable change—One of the following applies: (i) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were available, and the percentage of targeted change achieved was not statistically significant; (ii) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had achieved less than 10% of the targeted change; (iii) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were available, and the percent change relative to the baseline was not statistically significant; (iv) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had moved less than 10% relative to the baseline; (v) No change was observed between the baseline and the final data point.

d. Got worse—One of the following applies: (i) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were available, and the percent change relative to the baseline was statistically significant; (ii) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had moved 10% or more relative to the baseline.

The interventions included extensive HIV testing, linkage to care, and universal treatment services. To reduce HIV incidence in the intervention communities, the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals were used: 90% of HIV-positive persons know their status; 90% of persons who know status are to be on ART; 90% of persons on ART are to be virally suppressed. The BCPP study is composed of 2 interlocking protocols: Evaluation Protocol and Intervention Protocol. The Evaluation Protocol of the BCPP evaluated the primary endpoint (HIV incidence), as well as some key related secondary endpoints. This protocol focused on the Baseline Household Survey; the HIV Incidence Cohort; and an End of Study Survey. The Intervention Protocol of the BCPP implemented the combination prevention (CP) intervention package in CPCs and measures the uptake of these interventions (expanded HIV testing and counselling, strengthened male circumcision, and expanded HIV Care and Treatment).",N/A,0

519,Ability to handle a COVID-19 outbreak (CVAC),"This map shows estimates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy rates using data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey (HPS). We estimate hesitancy rates in two steps. First, we estimate hesitancy rates at the state level using the HPS for the collection period March 3, 2021 – March 15, 2021, which is referred to as Week 26. Then, we utilize the estimated values to predict hesitancy rates in more granular areas using the Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS). To create county-level estimates, we used a PUMA-to-county crosswalk from the Missouri Census Data Center. PUMAs spanning multiple counties had their estimates apportioned across those counties based on overall 2010 Census populations. 

We use the HPS survey question, “Once a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is available to you, would you…get a vaccine?”, which provides the following options: 1) “definitely get a vaccine”; 2) “probably get a vaccine”; 3) “probably not get a vaccine”; 4) “definitely not get a vaccine”. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was defined as follows: 

hesitancy: includes survey responses indicating that they would “probably not” or “definitely not” receive a COVID-19 vaccine when available.
strong hesitancy: include only survey responses indicating that they would “definitely not” receive a COVID-19 vaccine when available.
Full methodology for estimates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is available here.
Demographic data were obtained from the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates. 
 
Overall social vulnerability index was obtained from the 2018 CDC Social Vulnerability Index.  The CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) summarizes the extent to which a community is socially vulnerable to disaster. The factors considered in developing the SVI include economic data as well as data regarding education, family characteristics, housing language ability, ethnicity, and vehicle access. SVI values range from 0 (least vulnerable) to 1 (most vulnerable). The SVI can also be categorized as follows: Very Low (0.0-0.19), Low (0.20-0.39); Moderate (0.40-0.59); High (0.60-0.79); Very High (0.80-1.0).

The ability to handle a COVID-19 outbreak was obtained from the Surgo Covid-19 Vaccine Coverage Index (CVAC).  The Covid-19 Vaccine Coverage (CVAC) Index measures how well a community may be able to handle the repercussions of a COVID-19 outbreak. CVAC is based on a community's access to health care, affordable housing, transportation, childcare, or safe and secure employment. CVAC Index values range from 0 (least vulnerable) to 1 (most vulnerable). The CVAC Index can also be categorized as follows: Very Low (0.0-0.19), Low (0.20-0.39); Moderate (0.40-0.59); High (0.60-0.79); Very High (0.80-1.0).

520,2022–2023 Nationwide Blood Donor Seroprevalence Survey Combined Infection- and Vaccination-Induced Seroprevalence Estimates,"CDC is collaborating with Vitalant Research Institute, American Red Cross, and Westat Inc. to conduct a nationwide COVID-19 seroprevalence survey of blood donors. De-identified blood samples are tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the percentage of people in the United States who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and to track how this percentage changes over time. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines currently used in the United States result in production of anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies but only infection results in production of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies.

521,"PLACES: Census Tract Data (GIS Friendly Format), 2021 release","This dataset contains model-based census tract level estimates for the PLACES 2021 release in GIS-friendly format. PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 or 2014–2018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census tract 2015 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the census tract level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.

Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.

The surveillance case definition for COVID-19, a nationally notifiable disease, was first described in a <a href=""https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-2021/"">position statement</a> from the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, which was later <a href=""https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/"">revised</a>. However, there is some variation in how jurisdictions implemented these case definitions. More information on how CDC collects COVID-19 case surveillance data can be found at <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html"">FAQ: COVID-19 Data and Surveillance</a>.

<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process</b>
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, data were reported from state and local health departments through a robust process with the following steps:
<ul><li>Aggregate county-level counts were obtained indirectly, via automated overnight web collection, or directly, via a data submission process.</li><li>If more than one official county data source existed, CDC used a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source to retrieve the highest case and death counts, unless otherwise specified by the state.</li><li>A CDC data team reviewed counts for congruency prior to integration and set up alerts to monitor for discrepancies in the data.</li><li>CDC routinely compiled these data and post the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker.</li><li>County level data were aggregated to obtain state- and territory- specific totals.</li><li>Counting of cases and deaths is based on date of report and not on the date of symptom onset. CDC calculates rates in these data by using population estimates provided by the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program (2019 Vintage).</li><li>COVID-19 aggregate case and death data are organized in a time series that includes cumulative number of cases and deaths as reported by a jurisdiction on a given date.  New case and death counts are calculated as the week-to-week change in cumulative counts of cases and deaths reported (i.e., newly reported cases and deaths = cumulative number of cases/deaths reported this week minus the cumulative total reported the prior week.</li></ul>

This process was collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provided the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. Throughout data collection, CDC retrospectively updated counts to correct known data quality issues.

<b>Description</b>
This archived public use dataset focuses on the cumulative and weekly case and death rates per 100,000 persons within various sociodemographic factors across all states and their counties. All resulting data are expressed as rates calculated as the number of cases or deaths per 100,000 persons in counties meeting various classification criteria using <a href=""https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html"">the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program</a> (2019 Vintage).

Each county within jurisdictions is classified into multiple categories for each factor. All rates in this dataset are based on classification of counties by the characteristics of their population, not individual-level factors.  This applies to each of the available factors observed in this dataset. Specific factors and their corresponding categories are detailed below.

This dataset includes 2016, 2015 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2016, 2015), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2012-2016, 2011-2015 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening) from the 2015 BRFSS that are the same in the 2018 release as the previous 2017 release.

605,2020 Final Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Success Rates,"ART data are made available as part of the National ART Surveillance System (NASS) that collects success rates, services, profiles and annual summary data from fertility clinics across the U.S. There are four datasets available: ART Services and Profiles, ART Patient and Cycle Characteristics, ART Success Rates, and ART Summary. All four datasets may be linked by “ClinicID.” ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Success Rates dataset contains success rates for ART cycles started during the year indicated. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using their own eggs or donor eggs, success rates are included separately for these two groups. Success rates for patients using their own eggs are shown per intended retrieval, per actual retrieval, and per transfer. These success rates are reported as cumulative success rates, which take into account transfers that occur within 1 year after an egg retrieval. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using ART for the first time or had prior ART cycles, users can examine success rates for all “Patients using their own eggs” or for “Patients with no prior ART using their own eggs.” For new patients using ART for the first time, the success rates are also shown after 1, 2, or all intended egg retrievals during the reporting year. In addition, the average number of transfers per intended retrieval and the average number of intended retrievals per live-birth delivery are shown. Success rates for ART cycles that involve the transfer of embryos created from donor eggs or donated embryos are shown and are not cumulative. They are based on donor cycles started in the year indicated that had embryo transfers, regardless of when the donor eggs were retrieved. Success rates in this section are not presented by patient age group because previous data show that an intended parent’s age does not substantially affect success when using donor eggs or donated embryos. The success rates are presented by types of embryos and eggs used in the transfer.

In addition, the trend over time both as of the given row date and as of the most current data submitted is characterized as increasing, decreasing or stable to provide awareness of how the weekly trend is changing for the given geographic region.

For the emergency department time series, trajectory classifications reported on the opening page are based on rolling regression model assessments of the slope for each respiratory illness. Weeks with a significant time term (p <0.05) are classified as increasing when the slope is positive and decreasing when the slope is negative. Weeks with a non-significant time term (p ≥ 0.05) are classified as stable. A 3-week moving average is applied to the time series prior to the regression procedure in order to smooth week-to-week variation.

NHIS is conducted continuously throughout the year by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Public-use data files on adults and children with corresponding imputed income data files, and survey paradata are released annually. The NHIS data website (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/documentation/index.html) features the most up-to-date public-use data files and documentation for downloading including questionnaire, codebooks, CSV and ASCII data files, programs and sample code, and in-depth survey description. Most of the NHIS data are included in the public use files. NHIS is protected by Federal confidentiality laws that state the data collected by NCHS may be used only for statistical reporting and analysis. Some NHIS variables have been suppressed or edited in the public use files to protect confidentiality. Analysts interested in using data that has been suppressed or edited may apply for access through the NCHS Research Data Center at https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/.

627,An aggregated dataset of serially collected influenza A virus morbidity and titer measurements from virus-infected ferrets.,"Data from influenza A virus (IAV) infected ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) provides invaluable information towards the study of novel and emerging viruses that pose a threat to human health. This gold standard animal model can recapitulate many clinical signs of infection present in IAV-infected humans, support virus replication of human and zoonotic strains without prior adaptation, and permit evaluation of virus transmissibility by multiple modes. While ferrets have been employed in risk assessment settings for >20 years, results from this work are typically reported in discrete stand-alone publications, making aggregation of raw data from this work over time nearly impossible. Here, we describe a dataset of 728 ferrets inoculated with 126 unique IAV, conducted by a single research group (NCIRD/ID/IPB/Pathogenesis Laboratory Team) under a uniform experimental protocol. This collection of morbidity, mortality, and viral titer data represents the largest publicly available dataset to date of in vivo-generated IAV infection outcomes on a per-individual ferret level.

Specific drugs were identified using methods for searching literal text from death certificates. 

The provisional data are based on a current flow of mortality data and include reported 12 month-ending provisional counts of drug overdose deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence and specified drug. Provisional drug overdose death counts presented on this page are for “12-month ending periods,” defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2022 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022. Evaluation of trends over time should compare estimates from year to year (June 2021 and June 2022), rather than month to month, to avoid overlapping time periods. It is important to note that the data represent counts of deaths, and not mortality ratios or rates, which are the standard measure used to compare groups, and therefore should not be used to determine populations at disproportionate risk of drug overdose death.",N/A,9

The resulting head and face measurements were used to develop an anthropometric database detailing the face size distributions of respirator users using both traditional measurement methods and three-dimensional (3D) scanning systems. This database was used to establish fit test panels to be incorporated into NIOSH respirator certification and international standards. One of the panels developed, called the principal component analysis (PCA) panel, uses the first two principal components obtained from a set of 10 facial dimensions (age and race adjusted) and divides user population into five face-size categories. These 10 dimensions are associated with respirator fit and leakage and can predict the remaining face dimensions as well. Respirators designed to fit these panels are expected to accommodate more than 95% of the current U.S. civilian workers.

729,Inhalation of polycarbonate emissions generated during 3D printing processes affects neuroendocrine function in male rats,"Three-dimensional printing (3DP) of manufactured goods has increased in the last 10 yrs.  The increased use of this technology has resulted in questions about the health effects of inhaling emissions generated during printing.  The goal of this study was to determine if inhalation of particulate and toxic chemicals generated during printing with polycarbonate (PC) plastic affected the neuroendocrine system.  Male rats were exposed to 3D-printer emissions (500 µg/cm3) or filtered air for 1, 4, 8, 15 or 30d for 4d/week (4h/day).  The effects of these exposures on hormone concentrations, and markers of function, injury and/or oxidative stress in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus and testes were measured after 1, 8 and 30d of exposure.  Thirty days of exposure to 3D-emissions resulted in reductions in  thyroid stimulating hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and prolactin.  These changes were accompanied by increases in markers of cell injury and reductions in active mitochondria in the olfactory bulb, gonadotropin releasing hormone cells and fibers and tyrosine hydroxylase immunolabeled fibers in the arcuate nucleus, and reductions in spermatogonium.  PC plastics contain high concentrations bisphenol A and these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the health effects of inhaling 3D-printer emissions may be due to bisphenol A.",N/A,0

750,"National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) Restricted Data, 1965-2010","The National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), conducted from 1965 to 2010, was a national probability survey designed to meet the need for information on characteristics of inpatients discharged from non-Federal short-stay hospitals in the United States. From 1988-2007 the NHDS collected data from a sample of approximately 270,000 inpatient records acquired from a national sample of about 500 hospitals. From 2008 to 2010 the sample size was reduced to 239. Only hospitals with an average length of stay of fewer than 30 days for all patients, general hospitals, or children’s general hospitals are included in the survey. Federal, military, and Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals, as well as hospital units of institutions (such as prison hospitals), and hospitals with fewer than six beds staffed for patient use, are excluded.

Beginning in 1988, two data collection procedures have been used in the survey. The medical abstract form and the automated data tapes contain items that relate to the personal characteristics of the patient. These items include age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, and expected sources of payment. Administrative items such as admission and discharge dates (which allow calculation of length of stay), as well as discharge status are also included. Medical information about patients includes diagnoses and procedures coded to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM).",N/A,0

The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census tract 2015 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 36 measures at the census tract level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.

787,Development of an Empirically Derived Measure of Food Safety Culture in Restaurants,"A poor food safety culture has been described as an emerging risk factor for foodborne illness outbreaks, yet there has been little research on this topic in the retail food industry. The purpose of this study was to identify and validate conceptual domains around food safety culture and develop an assessment tool that can be used to assess food workers’ perceptions of their restaurant’s food safety culture. The study, conducted from March 2018 through March 2019, surveyed restaurant food workers for their level of agreement with 28 statements. We received 579 responses from 331 restaurants spread across eight different health department jurisdictions. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling supported a model composed of four primary constructs. The highest rated construct was Resource Availability (
=4.69, sd=0.57), which assessed the availability of resources to maintain good hand hygiene. The second highest rated construct was Employee Commitment (=4.49, sd=0.62), which assessed workers’ perceptions of their coworkers’ commitment to food safety. The last two constructs were related to management. Leadership (=4.28, sd=0.69) assessed the existence of food safety policies, training, and information sharing. Management Commitment (=3.94, sd=1.05) assessed whether food safety was a priority in practice. Finally, the model revealed one higher-order construct, Worker Beliefs about Food Safety Culture (=4.35, sd=0.53).

PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities Project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, and 9 on using preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 or 2014–2018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

• Influenza vaccination coverage for children and adults is assessed through U.S. jurisdictions’ Immunization Information Systems (IIS) data, submitted from jurisdictions to CDC monthly in aggregate by age group. More information about the IIS can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/about.html.

• Influenza vaccination coverage estimate numerators include the number of people receiving at least one dose of influenza vaccine in a given flu season, based on information that state, territorial, and local public health agencies report to CDC. Some jurisdictions’ data may include data submitted by tribes. Estimates include persons who are deceased but received a vaccination during the current season. People receiving doses are attributed to the jurisdiction in which the person resides unless noted otherwise. Quality and completeness of data may vary across jurisdictions. Influenza vaccination coverage denominators are obtained from 2020 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates.

• Monthly estimates shown are cumulative, reflecting all persons vaccinated from July through a given month of that flu season. Cumulative estimates include any historical data reported since the previous submission. National estimates are not presented since not all U.S. jurisdictions are currently reporting their IIS data to CDC. Jurisdictions reporting data to CDC include U.S. states, some localities, and territories.

• Because IIS data contain all vaccinations administered within a jurisdiction rather than a sample, standard errors were not calculated and statistical testing for differences in estimates across years were not performed.

• Laws and policies regarding the submission of vaccination data to an IIS vary by state, which may impact the completeness of vaccination coverage reflected for a jurisdiction. More information on laws and policies are found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/policy-legislation.html.

• Coverage estimates based on IIS data are expected to differ from National Immunization Survey (NIS) estimates for children (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-coverage-race.html)
and adults (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-adult-coverage.html) because NIS estimates are based on a sample that may not be representative after survey weighting and vaccination status is determined by survey respondent rather than vaccine records or administrations, and quality and completeness of IIS data may vary across jurisdictions. In general, NIS estimates tend to overestimate coverage due to overreporting and IIS estimates may underestimate coverage due to incompleteness of data in certain jurisdictions.",N/A,8

839,Examination of SARS-CoV-2 serological test results from multiple commercial and laboratory platforms with an in-house serum panel,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel human coronavirus that was identified in 2019. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in an acute, severe respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global public health crisis, which continues to affect populations across the globe. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the reference standard test for COVID-19 diagnosis. Serological tests are valuable tools for serosurveillance programs and establishing correlates of protection from disease. This study evaluated the performance of one in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizing the pre-fusion stabilized ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), two commercially available chemiluminescence assays Ortho VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Reagent Pack and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and one commercially available Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (sVNT), GenScript USA Inc., cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies.  Using a panel of rRT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients’ sera and a negative control group as a reference standard, all three immunoassays demonstrated high comparable positivity rates and low discordant rates.  All three immunoassays were highly sensitive with estimated sensitivities ranging from 95.4%-96.6%. ROC curve analysis indicated that all three immunoassays had high diagnostic accuracies with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.9698-0.9807. High positive correlation was demonstrated among the conventional microneutralization test (MNT) titers and the sVNT inhibition percent values.  Our study indicates that independent evaluations are necessary to optimize the overall utility and the interpretation of the results of serological tests.  Overall, we demonstrate that all serological tests evaluated in this study are suitable for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.",N/A,14

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 27 measures: 5 chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors, 13 health outcomes, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

• Influenza vaccination coverage for children and adults is assessed through U.S. jurisdictions’ Immunization Information Systems (IIS) data, submitted from jurisdictions to CDC monthly in aggregate by age group. More information about the IIS can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/about.html. 

• Influenza vaccination coverage estimate numerators include the number of people receiving at least one dose of influenza vaccine in a given flu season, based on information that state, territorial, and local public health agencies report to CDC. Some jurisdictions’ data may include data submitted by tribes. Estimates include persons who are deceased but received a vaccination during the current season. People receiving doses are attributed to the jurisdiction in which the person resides unless noted otherwise. Quality and completeness of data may vary across jurisdictions. Influenza vaccination coverage denominators are obtained from 2020 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. 

• Monthly estimates shown are cumulative, reflecting all persons vaccinated from July through a given month of that flu season. Cumulative estimates include any historical data reported since the previous submission. National estimates are not presented since not all U.S. jurisdictions are currently reporting their IIS data to CDC. Jurisdictions reporting data to CDC include U.S. states, some localities, and territories. 

• Because IIS data contain all vaccinations administered within a jurisdiction rather than a sample, standard errors were not calculated and statistical testing for differences in estimates across years were not performed. 

• Laws and policies regarding the submission of vaccination data to an IIS vary by state, which may impact the completeness of vaccination coverage reflected for a jurisdiction. More information on laws and policies are found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/policy-legislation.html. 

• Coverage estimates based on IIS data are expected to differ from National Immunization Survey (NIS) estimates for children (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-coverage-race.html)                 
and adults (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-adult-coverage.html) because NIS estimates are based on a sample that may not be representative after survey weighting and vaccination status is determined by survey respondent rather than vaccine records or administrations, and quality and completeness of IIS data may vary across jurisdictions. In general, NIS estimates tend to overestimate coverage due to overreporting and IIS estimates may underestimate coverage due to incompleteness of data in certain jurisdictions.",N/A,13

All nursing homes that participated in the NNHS had at least three beds and were either certified (by Medicare or Medicaid) or had a state license to operate as a nursing home. The redesigned survey was administered using a computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) system. The National Nursing Home Survey provides information on nursing homes from two perspectives-that of the provider of services and that of the recipient of care. Data about the facilities include characteristics such as size, ownership, Medicare/Medicaid certification, services provided and specialty programs offered, and charges. For recipients, data were obtained on demographic characteristics, health status and medications taken, services received, and sources of payment.

Data for the survey were obtained through personal interviews with facility administrators and designated staff who used administrative records to answer questions about the facilities, staff, services and programs, and medical records to answer questions about the residents.

926,"PLACES: Place Data (GIS Friendly Format), 2020 release","This dataset contains model-based place (incorporated and census designated places) level estimates for the PLACES project 2020 release in GIS-friendly format. The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the 2019 Census TIGER/Line place boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the place level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available at https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=8eca985039464f4d83467b8f6aeb1320 for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.",N/A,118

It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 or 2014–2018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census 2010 ZCTA boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the ZCTA level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.

This assessment is designed to describe how the environment contributed to the outbreak and identifies factors that contributed to the outbreak and environmental antecedents to the outbreak. Environmental antecedents, also referred to as root causes, are specific reasons that allow biological or chemical agents to contaminate, survive, or grow in food. From 2017 – 2019, 24 jurisdictions reported 1,430 antecedents from 393 outbreaks to the National Environmental Assessments Reporting System. The most reported antecedents were lack of oversight of employees/enforcement of policies (89.1%), lack of training of employees on specific processes (74.0%), and lack of a food safety culture/attitude towards food safety (57.5%). These findings highlight the critical role that employees play in restaurant food safety and are heavily influenced by restaurant management, who can exercise active managerial control to manage these antecedents.

974,National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Restricted Data: Prior to 1999,"The <b> National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</b> (NHANES) is designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews with standardized physical examinations and laboratory tests. <br>
NHANES was conducted on a periodic basis from 1971 to 1994, including NHANES I (1971-1975), NHANES II (1976-1980), NHANES III (1988-1994), and a Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES, 1982-1984). In 1999, NHANES became continuous and has been collecting data annually ever since. <br>
All of the NHANES programs utilized a stratified, multistage probability cluster design to provide a nationally representative sample of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component conducted in a mobile examination center consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as the collection of biospecimens, such as blood and urine for laboratory testing.

It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 or 2014–2018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the 2019 Census TIGER/Line place boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the place level.

988,Preliminary 2024-2025 U.S. RSV Burden Estimates,"This dataset represents preliminary estimates of cumulative U.S. RSV –associated disease burden estimates for the 2024-2025 season, including outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Real-time estimates are preliminary and based on continuously collected surveillance data from patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. The data  come from the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET), a surveillance platform that captures data from hospitals that serve about 8% of the U.S. population. Each week CDC estimates a range (i.e., lower estimate and an upper estimate) of RSV-associated disease burden estimates that have occurred since October 1, 2024.  

<b>Note:</b> Data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Rates for recent RSV-associated hospital admissions are subject to reporting delays; as new data are received each week, previous rates are updated accordingly.  

<b>Note:</b> Preliminary burden estimates are not inclusive of data from all RSV-NET sites. Due to model limitations, sites with small sample sizes can impact estimates in unpredictable ways and are excluded for the benefit of model stability. CDC is working to address model limitations and include data from all sites in final burden estimates.

PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015–2019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for seven measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year.

1009,2004 National Nursing Home Survey - Restricted Current Resident Dataset,"The 2004 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS), conducted between August and December of 2004, was reintroduced into the field after a five-year break, during which time the survey was redesigned and expanded to collect many new data items. All nursing homes that participated in the NNHS had at least three beds and were either certified (by Medicare or Medicaid) or had a state license to operate as a nursing home. The redesigned survey was administered using a computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) system. The National Nursing Home Survey provides information on nursing homes from two perspectives-that of the provider of services and that of the recipient of care. Data about the facilities include characteristics such as size, ownership, Medicare/Medicaid certification, services provided and specialty programs offered, and charges. For recipients, data were obtained on demographic characteristics, health status and medications taken, services received, and sources of payment.

Data for the survey were obtained through personal interviews with facility administrators and designated staff who used administrative records to answer questions about the facilities, staff, services and programs, and medical records to answer questions about the residents.

The total number of nursing home facilities that participated in NNHS is 1,174.",N/A,0

PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015–2019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year.

NAMCS began in 1973 as a national probability sample survey of visits to nonfederally employed office-based physicians. NCHS conducted the survey annually through 1981, again in 1985, and annually through 2021 (collection of visit data from physicians was stopped during 2020–2021 due to the burden placed on respondents by the COVID-19 pandemic). In 2006, a separate sample of Community Health Centers (CHCs) was added to the survey; the CHC component samples visits to both physicians and advanced practice providers (nurse practitioners, PAs [physician assistants and physician associates], and certified nurse midwives). Starting in 2012, in addition to the traditional NAMCS file, a separate data file for CHCs including physicians and advanced practice providers has been released.

In 2021, the former CHC sample of NAMCS was redesigned and launched as the NAMCS Health Center (HC) Component, collecting visit data from HCs using electronic health records, or EHR, systems of the participating health centers.

It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015–2019 estimates.

Vaccine administration (coverage) data reported to CDC were aggregated by U.S. reporting jurisdiction, MMWR week of vaccination (≥14 days after completing the primary vaccine series), FDA-approved vaccine products, and age group (5–11, 12–17, 18–49, 50–64, ≥65 years). 
Vaccination status: A person vaccinated with at least a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably completing BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) primary series. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series ≥14 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected. 
To estimate the number of unvaccinated persons in each MMWR week, the 2019 U.S. Census population estimates by jurisdiction and age group were used (except for California, where State Department of Finance 2021 population projections were determined to be more accurate). The number of unvaccinated persons each MMWR week was estimated by subtracting the cumulative number of vaccinated (all products) and partially vaccinated persons (all products) from the respective population totals for each jurisdiction and age group. 
Continuity correction: A continuity correction has been applied to the denominators by capping the percent population coverage at 95%. To do this, we assumed that at least 5% of each age group would always be unvaccinated in each jurisdiction. Adding this correction ensures that there is always a reasonable denominator for the unvaccinated population that would prevent rates from growing unrealistically large due to potential overestimates of vaccination coverage.",N/A,7

1180,NPPTL Filtering Facepiece Respirators with an Exhalation Valve: Measurements of Filtration Efficiency to Evaluate Their Potential for Source Control,"Filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are used extensively by healthcare personnel (HCP) during a pandemic. FFRs are primarily reserved for those personnel who have a greater risk and longer duration of exposure compared with other workers and the general public. Some FFR models contain an exhalation valve, which is a device that closes to allow inhaled breath to be pulled through the filter media and opens to allow exhaled breath to be expelled from the respirator through the exhalation valve as well as the filter media. These FFR models provide the wearer with a level of protection like that of an FFR without an exhalation valve, and they are thought to increase the wearer’s comfort at high work rates and be suitable for longer periods of use. However, respiratory secretions expelled by wearers may exit along with air through the exhalation valve. A concern with FFRs with an exhalation valve is that individuals may spread disease if unfiltered, virus-laden aerosols pass through the valve.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not recommend using an FFR with an exhalation valve for source control (i.e., to filter respiratory secretions to prevent disease transmission to others) and advised that if only this option isavailable and source control was needed, then the valve should be covered with a surgical mask, procedure mask, or a cloth face covering that does not interfere with the respirator fit. The CDC requested research to provide improved science-based recommendations on the use of exhalation valves.

This study had three aims: (1) to measure the filtration efficiency provided by FFRs with an exhalation valve under conditions of inward airflow (i.e., in the direction of inhalation) and outward airflow (i.e., in the direction of exhalation); (2) to evaluate how particle penetration in FFRs with an exhalation valve compares to particle penetration in surgical masks, procedure masks, cloth face coverings, and fabric from cotton t-shirts; and (3) to determine the filtration efficiency of three modifications to the exhalation valve in FFRs with the goal of mitigating the emission of unfiltered particles. To accomplish these three aims, thirteen FFR models were each tested in two positions: inward position, which is used by the NIOSH Respirator Approval Program when testing N-type respirators, and outward position, which was used experimentally to channel airflow in the direction of exhalation. For the inward position, three mitigation strategies were used:
(1)covering the valve on the interior of the FFR with commonly available surgical tape,
(2)covering the valve on the interior of the FFR with an electrocardiogram (ECG) pad; and
(3)stretching a surgical mask over the exterior of the FFR.

The purpose of these three strategies was to measure the varying filtration efficiencies to determine their contribution toward source control. Both positions and all mitigation strategies were tested at three airflow rates: 25, 55, and 85 lpm (liters per minute). In addition to the FFR evaluations, researchers evaluated a selection of surgical masks, procedure masks, cloth face coverings, and fabric from cotton t-shirts using the outward position and flowrates described previously.",N/A,0

1201,The effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on cardiovascular function,"Air pollution serves as a major risk factor for the development of asthma, respiratory disease and heart disease. Diesel particulate and fumes are a major contributor to air pollution. Workers in a number of different occupations, including mining, oil and gas exploration and refining, and drivers of heavy equipment who are regularly exposed to diesel exhaust while on the job, and persons living in areas with high levels of air pollution, are at an increased risk for developing asthma, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers.

Understanding the physiological and cellular effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on Various organs in the body is critical for identifying exposure-induced biological and physiological markers of disease or dysfunction. The experiments in this manuscript, focus on the effects of diesel exhaust (DE) inhalation on peripheral and cardiovascular function. In the current studies, we hypothesized that the development of cardiovascular disease in workers regularly exposed to DE is the result of the inhalation of volatile gases and particulate within the vapor that affect the cardiovascular system by altering physiological and cellular processes that affect peripheral vascular responsiveness to agents that cause blood vessels to constrict and vessels that cause blood vessels to dilate, blood pressure, cardiac output and kidney function (kidney function as it may contribute to changes in blood pressure). We also predicted that these changes in physiology would be associated with changes in the expression of proteins and the production of genes that play a role in regulating oxidative stress, responses to decreases in oxygen, and markers of kidney function that are associated with blood pressure.",N/A,0

Methods: We examined 2000–2008 audiograms for male and female workers ages 18–65, who had higher occupational noise exposures than the general population. Prevalence and adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) for hearing loss were estimated and compared across industries.

Results: In our sample, 18% of workers had hearing loss. When compared with the Couriers and Messengers industry sub-sector, workers employed in Mining (PR = 1.65, CI = 1.57–1.73), Wood Product Manufacturing (PR = 1.65, CL = 1.61– 1.70), Construction of Buildings (PR = 1.59, CI = 1.51–1.68), and Real Estate and Rental and Leasing (PR = 1.61, CL = 1.51–1.71) had higher risks for hearing loss.

Conclusions: Workers in the Mining, Manufacturing, and Construction industries need better engineering controls for noise and stronger hearing conservation strategies. More hearing loss research is also needed within traditional ‘‘low-risk’’ industries like Real Estate.",N/A,0

1214,Total Inward Leakage (TIL) for Respiratory Protective Devices,"Total inward leakage (TIL) is an estimate of the performance of a respirator, which is measured as the leakage of contaminants through the filter media and through the faceseal interface and exhalation valve of respiratory protective devices under laboratory conditions. Several test agents have been used to measure TIL in different countries. There is a lack of consensus on the most appropriate test method to measure TIL. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed a standard (ISO, 2014) on the comparison of TIL measurement using sodium chloride (NaCl) and corn oil aerosols, and sulfur hexafluoride gas. A comparison of the TIL values between different methods will enable the selection of a relatively suitable method for measuring TIL. NIOSH’s National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) investigated the TIL values for respirators worn by test subjects exposed to NaCl and corn oil aerosols in two aerosol chambers side-by-side.

Methods: Audiograms for 1.8 million workers from 1981-2010 were examined. Incidence and prevalence were estimated by industry sector and time period. The adjusted risk of incident hearing loss within each time period and industry sector as compared with a reference time period was also estimated.

Results: The adjusted risk for incident hearing loss decreased over time when all industry sectors were combined. However, the risk remained high for workers in Healthcare and Social Assistance, and the prevalence was consistently high for Mining and Construction workers.

Conclusions: While progress has been made in reducing the risk of incident hearing loss within most industry sectors, additional efforts are needed within Mining, Construction and Healthcare and Social Assistance.",N/A,0
1216,Respirator Performance against Nanoparticles under Simulated Workplace Activities Data,"Filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and elastomeric half-mask respirators (EHRs) are commonly used by workers for protection against potentially hazardous particles, including engineered nanoparticles (i.e., particles measuring less than 100 nanometers (nm). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of these types of respirators against 10-400 nm particles using human subjects exposed to NaCl aerosols under simulated workplace activities. Simulated workplace protection factors (SWPFs) were measured for eight combinations of respirator models (2 N95 FFRs, 2 P100 FFRs, 2 N95 EHRs, and 2 P100 EHRs) worn by 25 healthy test subjects (13 females and 12 males) with varying face sizes. Before beginning a SWPF test for a given respirator model, each subject had to pass a quantitative fit test. Each SWPF test was performed using a protocol of six exercises for three minutes each: (i) normal breathing, (ii) deep breathing, (iii) moving head side to side, (iv) moving head up and down, (v) bending at th",N/A,0

PFHpA, PFHxA, and PFPeA are short-chain PFAS (C7, C6, C5, respectively) that have been labeled as a safer alternative to the legacy PFAS perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS) which have been linked to numerous health effects.  This class of chemicals are incorporated into consumer products such as stain resistant carpeting and textiles, nanosprays, medical devices, and fire-fighting foams.  There is a high potential for occupational exposure and in the environment, short-chain PFAS have been detected in a variety of water sources leading to concerns for dermal exposure, however, these studies are lacking.  In previous studies from our lab, PFOA was demonstrated to be absorbed via the skin and immunomodulatory.  Also, the short-chain PFAS, PFBA, was found to have systemic toxic effects on mice with dermal exposure.  In the present study, the systemic toxicity of a 28-day dermal PFHpA, PFHxA, and PFPeA (1.25-5% w/v or v/v, or 31.25-125 mg/kg/dose) exposure was evaluated in a murine model.",N/A,0

1219,A model for detecting the effects of vibration on peripheral blood flow,"Exposure to hand-transmitted vibration (HTV) has been shown to result in cold-induced vasoconstriction and a reduction in blood flow to the hands and fingers of workers. Occupational exposure to HTV can also induce a hypersensitivity of the sympathetic nervous system to various stimuli, which in turn can result in vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels and blanching of the skin because of reductions in peripheral blood flow. The data presented were collected using an established animal model of vibration-induced white finger (Welcome et al. 2008) to determine if changes in blood flow induced by vibration exposure could be used as a biomarker for the development of vibration-induced peripheral vascular disease. Two separate experiments were done. In Experiment 1, changes in blood flow were measured in the ventral tail artery of the rat tail before and after a 4 h exposure to tail vibration (frequency 125 Hz, amplitude 5 g).

1220,Evaluation of Propylene Glycol Methyl Ether as a Potential Challenge Agent for Leak Detection of Liquid and Headspace from Closed System Drug Transfer Devices using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy,"Measurement of vapors from solutions containing propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME) released inside a closed chamber were evaluated. Data used to quantify limits of detection, limits of quantification, bias, precision, and accuracy of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements of vapors from 2.5 M PGME solutions are presented. The effects of ethanol as a component of the PGME solution were also evaluated. Liquid drops of PGME solutions and headspace vapors above PGME solutions were released to simulate leaks from Closed System Drug-Transfer Devices (CSTD)s. Using a calibration apparatus, an instrumental LOD of 0.25 ppmv and a LOQ of 0.8 ppmv were determined for PGME vapor. A LOD of 1.1 µL and a LOQ of 3.5 µL was determined for liquid aliquots of 2.5 M PGME solution released in the NIOSH chamber. Accurate quantitation of liquid leaks required complete evaporation of droplets. With the upper end of the usable quantitation range limited by slow evaporation of relatively large droplets and the lower end defined by the method LOQ, the method has a narrow quantitative range for liquid droplets. Displacement of 45 mL of vial headspace containing PGME vapor is the largest amount expected when using the draft NIOSH testing protocol. Release of an unfiltered 45 mL headspace aliquot within the NIOSH chamber was calculated to produce a concentration of 0.8 ppmv based on the Henry’s constant, which is right at the instrumental LOQ.  Therefore, the sensitivity of the method was not adequate to determine leaks of PGME vapor from a headspace release through an air filtering CSTD when using the draft NIOSH testing protocols with an FTIR analyzer.",N/A,0

To reduce exposure to these droplets and aerosols while indoors, CDC recommends measures including physical distancing, universal mask wearing, and room ventilation. Ventilation systems can be supplemented with portable air cleaners to remove infectious material from the air more quickly and provide greater protection. We conducted a case study using respiratory simulators to examine the efficacy of portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaners and universal masking at reducing exposure to simulated exhaled aerosol particles from an infected meeting participant in a conference room. We found that, in a room with good air mixing, the use of two HEPA air cleaners meeting the EPA recommended Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) reduced the overall exposure by up to 65%, and that the combination of the HEPA air cleaners and universal masking reduced exposure by up to 90%. The air cleaners were most effective when they were close to the aerosol source. Our results demonstrate that portable HEPA cleaners can be an effective method to reduce exposure to airborne particles while meeting indoors, especially in combination with universal masking.",N/A,0

There was at least one site in each of the 10 Health and Human Services (HHS) regions. RESP-LENS collected reports of emergency department (ED) visits for acute respiratory illness (ARI) and corresponding viral testing results for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza (flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).  Sites reported data for an average of approximately 77,000 ED visits weekly, of which 11,000 were associated with ARI and 4,000 of those were in children younger than 18 years.  Between May 2023 and August 2024, these data were posted to CDC's RESP-LENS public dashboard, showing number tested, number positive, and percent positive for each of the three viruses mentioned, by virus, region, and age group.  Due to budget constraints, RESP-LENS was not funded beyond the end of the 2024 fiscal year.

1227,2021 Final Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Success Rates,"Data were updated on September 11, 2024.

ART data are made available as part of the National ART Surveillance System (NASS) that collects success rates, services, profiles and annual summary data from fertility clinics across the U.S. There are four datasets available: ART Services and Profiles, ART Patient and Cycle Characteristics, ART Success Rates, and ART Summary. All four datasets may be linked by “ClinicID.” ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Success Rates dataset contains success rates for ART cycles started during the year indicated. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using their own eggs or donor eggs, success rates are included separately for these two groups. Success rates for patients using their own eggs are shown per intended retrieval, per actual retrieval, and per transfer. These success rates are reported as cumulative success rates, which take into account transfers that occur within 1 year after an egg retrieval. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using ART for the first time or had prior ART cycles, users can examine success rates for all “Patients using their own eggs” or for “Patients with no prior ART using their own eggs.” For new patients using ART for the first time, the success rates are also shown after 1, 2, or all intended egg retrievals during the reporting year. In addition, the average number of transfers per intended retrieval and the average number of intended retrievals per live-birth delivery are shown. Success rates for ART cycles that involve the transfer of embryos created from donor eggs or donated embryos are shown and are not cumulative. They are based on donor cycles started in the year indicated that had embryo transfers, regardless of when the donor eggs were retrieved. Success rates in this section are not presented by patient age group because previous data show that an intended parent’s age does not substantially affect success when using donor eggs or donated embryos. The success rates are presented by types of embryos and eggs used in the transfer. This dataset excludes cycles that were considered research—that is, cycles performed to evaluate new procedures.",N/A,31
1228,Assessment of dermal sensitization by nickel salts in a novel humanized TLR-4 mouse model,"Nickel is one of the most common contact allergens worldwide. Despite this prevalence, many of the underlying immunological mechanisms responsible for nickel allergy remain unclear. This knowledge gap is partially attributable to the inherent resistance of laboratory rodents (mice and rats) to dermal sensitization with nickel salts. The fundamental goal of this study was to assess the potential utility of the novel humanized Toll-like receptor-4 (hTLR-4) mouse model for use in future in vivo studies of nickel allergy. Accordingly, hTLR-4 positive and negative mice of both sexes were first incorporated into a Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) to evaluate dermal sensitization following topical exposure to soluble nickel salts (NiSO4). The ensuing immune responses were then characterized further by incorporating female and male hTLR-4 positive mice into a non-radioactive endpoint-based assay. Utilizing the same exposure scheme as in the LLNA, mice were euthanized following exposure and the auricular lymph nodes, spleen, and blood were collected to assess various immunological parameters associated with allergy and ACD.",N/A,0
1229,An Investigation Into the Relationship Between Coal Workers’ Pneumoconiosis and Dust Exposure in U.S. Coal Miners,"The National Study of Coal Workers’ Pneumoconiosis (NSCWP) is a large, continuing epidemiologic study of the respiratory health of U.S. coal miners. By using information from the study, prevalence of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) was related to indexes of dust exposure obtained from research and compliance sampling data. Clear relationships between prevalences of both simple CWP and progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) and estimated dust exposure were seen. Additional effects independently associated with coal rank (% carbon) and age were also seen. Logistic model fitting indicated that between 2% and 12% of miners exposed to a 2-mg/m3 dust environment in bituminous coal mines would be expected to have Category 2 or greater CWP after a 40-yr working life; PMF would be expected for between 1.3% and 6.7%.

1232,Pulmonary evaluation of whole-body inhalation exposure of polycarbonate (PC) filament 3D printer emissions in rats,"Additive manufacturing (AM) is a broad manufacturing term that encompasses a range of processes that create objects by adding material through a computer-aided design model.  Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a form of AM, which builds objects layer-by-layer deposition of feedstock material using a 3D printer machine and computer software.  Fused filament fabrication (FFF, also known as Filament Freeform Fabrication) is one 3D printing process in which filaments are melted and extruded from a heated nozzle to deposit material.  FFF is an emerging technology and one of the most popular additive manufacturing processes, especially for consumers and small manufacturers.  Polycarbonate (PC) is a versatile material and PC filaments are widely used for fused filament fabrication 3D printing.  PC filaments are often loaded with additives to achieve different properties of the print objects.  These additives range from dyes, organometallic compounds, carbon nanomaterials, nanometal oxides to micrometer-scale particles such as copper, bronze, steel, tungsten, gold, and aluminum nitride (Vance et al., 2017).   Several engineered nanomaterials were infused into PC filaments, such as silicon dioxide nanoparticles, titanium nitride nanoparticles (Vidakis et al., 2021), titanium carbide nanopowder (Vidakis et al., 2022a), aluminum nitride nanoparticles (Vidakis et al., 2022b), and carbon nanotubes (Potter et al., 2021).

During heating, PC filament undergoes thermal degradation and releases fine particles (0.1 to 2.5 um) and incidental nanoparticles (d < 100 nm) as well as numerous volatile, and semi-volatile organic compounds that are likely derived from PC polymer and additives in the polymer (Azimi et al., 2016; Byrley et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2019; Stefaniak et al., 2017; Stefaniak et al., 2019; Alijagic et al., 2022; Tedla et al., 2022).   These emissions could pose a potential hazard to human health.  Currently, the potential health hazard of PC filament printing emissions has not been determined.

A NIOSH research group used a condensation nuclei counter to study PC filament emission rates, and determined that the number-based particle emission rates from an industrial-scale material extrusion AM machine were around 2.2 x1011 number/minute and the total volatile organic compound emission rates were around 1.9 x 104 µg/minute (Stefaniak et al., 2019).  The same group also found low levels of acetone, benzene, toluene, and m,p-xylene during PC filament printing processes.  Potter et al showed that PC filament emissions contained bisphenol A (BPA), phenol, chlorobenzene, DEHP, and di-tert-butylphenol (Potter et al., 2019).  In our previous studies on PC filament printer emission-induced cell toxicity (Farcas et al., 2019), emissions from a commercial PC 3D printer were generated in a chamber using a 3D printer and collected in cell culture medium.  The number-based size distribution of the particles inside the chamber was between 140-170 nm and the mean particle sizes in cell culture medium were 201±18 nm.  Analysis of elemental composition of particles collected in the cell culture medium found C, O, Ca, Na, Si, Ni, Cr, Fe, S, Al, and Cl.  The organic compounds in the emission collection cell culture medium were BPA, p-isopropenylphenol, and phenol.  At 24 h post-exposure, PC emissions were internalized in human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) and induced a dose-dependent cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, necrosis, and increases in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in SAEC (Farcas et al., 2019).  The results demonstrated that PC filament 3D printing emissions induce a cellular toxicity in SAEC.

1233,The β-adrenergic receptor blocker and anti-inflammatory drug propranolol mitigates brain cytokine expression in a long-term model of Gulf War Illness,"Growing evidence suggests that Gulf War Illness (GWI) is the result of underlying neuroimmune dysfunction.  For example, previously we found that several Gulf War-relevant organophosphate, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors produce heightened neuroinflammatory responses following a sub chronic stressor exposure.  The goal of the study was to evaluate the potential for the β-adrenergic receptor inhibitor and anti-inflammatory drug, propranolol, to treat neuroinflammation in a novel long-term mouse model of GWI. We established that our long-term GWI model produces enhanced and prolonged neuroinflammation that is dependent upon Gulf War-relevant organophosphate exposure. Propranolol treatment abrogated the neuroinflammation instigated in our model specifically, having no treatment effects in non-DFP exposed groups. Our results indicate that propranolol may be a promising therapy for GWI by treating the underlying neuroinflammation associated with Gulf War-relevant physiological stress and organophosphate exposures.",N/A,0
1234,Deepwater Horizon Response Air Sampling Data,"The April 20, 2010, explosion and collapse of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in the release of millions of barrels of oil into Gulf waters. The response to this disaster involved the efforts of tens of thousands of workers in a variety of capacities across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas, and in the Gulf of Mexico itself. The diverse work included oil and tar ball removal from beaches, oil skimming and booming near shores, burning of surface oil near the source of the oil release, surface application of dispersant by vessels and aircraft, and containment and recovery work on vessels at the release site. The nature of these activities raised concerns about potential occupational exposures to chemical and physical hazards and mental stressors.

NIOSH investigators conducted health hazard evaluations (HHEs) of Deepwater Horizon Response onshore and offshore workers. The goals of the NIOSH HHE assessments were to describe acute health effects, evaluate occupational exposures in qualitative or quantitative assessments, and generate hypotheses regarding symptoms potentially related to work activities. Environmental air samples were collected in support of the goals.

NIOSH investigators conducted the following exposure evaluations:

- We conducted evaluations on board vessels releasing dispersant. These vessels were deployed to perform small‐scale releases of dispersant in an area with surface oil contamination.
- We assessed exposures during in‐situ (i.e., on site) burns of surface oil.
- We assessed exposures on fishing and shrimping trawlers in the Vessels of Opportunity (VoO) program that were assigned to remove surface oil by booming and skimming.
- We assessed exposures aboard vessels located at the Deepwater Horizon incident site.

MS is primarily composed of Iron (Fe) and Manganese (Mn), while SS also contains chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni). We found that all three welding fumes had significant effects on cellular viability, and also caused increases in free radical production, while negatively affecting their invasive capabilities. MS was the only sample to cause an increase in production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8.

Prevalence of CWP was related to estimated cumulative dust exposure, age, and rank of coal. On the basis of these data, miners of medium to low rank coal, who work for 40 years at the current federal dust limit of 2 mg/m3, are predicted to have a 1.4% risk of having progressive massive fibrosis on retirement. Higher prevalences are predicted for less severe categories of CWP. Miners in high rank coal areas appear to be at greater risk than those mining medium and low rank coals. Ex-miners who said that they left mining for health-related reasons had higher levels of abnormality compared to current miners.",N/A,0
1237,"Economic Burden of Occupational Fatal Injuries in the United States Based on the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, 2003-2010","It is widely acknowledged that there are costs involved with fatal injury to workers. These costs cross numerous boundaries, and generally address the overall costs to victims and the affected groups, and to society as a whole. This represents a cause for concern to employers, worker groups, policy makers, medical personnel, economists and others interested in workplace safety and health. This broad-reaching burden can include social costs, organizational costs, familial and interpersonal group costs, as well as personal costs such as suffering and loss of companionship. The data in the accompanying tables focus on monetary costs of fatal occupational injury which largely consist of foregone wages, but also include the direct costs of medical care and the indirect costs of household production and certain ancillary measures.

These data represent a continuation of prior research by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) that attempted to delimit the economic consequences of workplace injury for earlier years. Interested parties should be aware that these data serve as a supplemental update to prior NIOSH publications which described the magnitude and circumstances of occupational injury deaths for earlier years 1,2.

The current data build on this research, and the findings are compelling. Over the period studied, 2003-2010, the costs from these 42,380 premature deaths exceeded $44 billion, an amount greater than the reportable gross domestic product for some States. These findings inform the national will to reduce this severe toll on our nation’s workers, institutions, communities, and the nation itself. Researchers and concerned parties within the occupational and public health professions, academia, organizations focusing on workplace safety, labor unions and the business community have all proven to be willing and avid users of this data, and have used this research to continue their efforts, in concert with continuing NIOSH research efforts, to reduce the great toll that injury imposes on our workers, workplaces, and Nation.",N/A,0
1238,Exposure to the antimicrobial chemical triclosan disrupts keratinocyte function and skin integrity in a model of reconstructed human epidermis,"Triclosan is an antimicrobial chemical incorporated into products that are applied to the skin of healthcare workers. Exposure to triclosan has previously been shown to be immunomodulatory and associated with allergic disease. Additionally, we have shown that exposure to triclosan dermally activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and disrupts the skin barrier integrity in mice. The skin is the largest organ in the body and plays an important role as a physical barrier and regulator of the immune system. Alterations in the barrier and immune regulatory functions of the skin have been demonstrated to increase the risk of sensitization and development of allergic disease. In this study, the impact of triclosan exposure on the skin barrier and keratinocyte function was investigated using a model of reconstructed human epidermis. The apical surface of reconstructed human epidermis was exposed to triclosan once for 6, 24, or 48 hours or daily for 5 consecutive days.",N/A,0
1239,Efficacy of universal masking for source control and personal protection from simulated respiratory aerosols in a room,"Masks block aerosols produced during coughs and exhalations (“source control”). Masks also slow and deflect cough and exhalation airflows, which changes the dispersion of aerosols. Factors such as the directions in which people are facing (orientation) and separation distance also affect aerosol dispersion. However, it is not clear how masking, orientation, and distance interact. We placed a respiratory aerosol simulator (“source”) and a breathing simulator (“recipient”) in a chamber and measured aerosol concentrations for different combinations of masking, orientation, and separation distance. When the simulators were front-to-front during coughing, masks reduced the 15-minute mean aerosol concentration at the recipient by 92% (p < 0.0001) at 0.9 and 1.8 m separation. When the simulators were side-by-side, masks reduced the concentration by 81% at 0.9 m and 78% at 1.8 m (p < 0.0001 for both). During breathing, masks reduced the aerosol concentration by 66% when front-to-front (p = 0.0056) and 76% when side-by-side (p < 0.0001) at 0.9 m. Similar results were seen at 1.8 m. When the simulators were unmasked, changing the orientations from front-to-front to side-by-side reduced the cough aerosol concentration by 59% at 0.9 m and 60% at 1.8 m (p < 0.0001 for both). When both simulators were masked, changing the orientations did not significantly change the concentration at either distance during coughing or breathing. Increasing the distance between the simulators from 0.9 m to 1.8 m during coughing reduced the aerosol concentration by 25% when no masks were worn (p < 0.0001) but had little effect when both simulators were masked (4% decrease, p = 0.7090). During breathing, when neither simulator was masked, increasing the separation reduced the concentration by 13%, which approached significance (p = 0.0737), while the change was not significant when both source and recipient were masked (8% decrease, p = 0.3235). Our results suggest that universal masking reduces exposure to respiratory aerosol particles regardless of the orientation and separation distance between the source and recipient.",N/A,0
1240,Optimization of Aspergillus versicolor culture and aerosolization in a murine model of inhalational fungal exposure,"Aspergillus versicolor is ubiquitous in the environment and is particularly abundant in damp indoor spaces. Exposure to Aspergillus species, as well as other environmental fungi, has been linked to adverse health outcomes including asthma, allergy, and even local or disseminated infection. However, the pulmonary immunological mechanisms associated with repeated exposure to A. versicolor have remained relatively uncharacterized. Here, A. versicolor was cultured and desiccated on rice, then placed in an acoustical generator system to achieve aerosolization. Mice were challenged with titrated doses of aerosolized conidia to examine deposition, lymphoproliferative properties, and then the immunotoxicological response to repeated inhalation exposures. The necessary dose to induce lymphoproliferation, but not infection-like pathology, was identified. Further, it was determined that the dose was able to initiate localized immune responses. The data presented in this study demonstrate an optimized and reproducible method for delivering A. versicolor conidia to rodents via nose-only inhalation. Additionally, the feasibility of a long-term repeated exposure study was established.  This experimental protocol can be used in future studies to investigate physiological effects of repeated pulmonary exposure to fungal conidia utilizing a practical and relevant mode of delivery.

1241,Systemic toxicity induced by topical application of heptafluorobutyric acid (PFBA) in a murine model,"Heptafluorobutyric acid (PFBA) is a synthetic chemical belonging to the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) group that includes over 5,000 chemicals.  PFBA is a short-chain PFAS (C4) that has been labeled as a safer alternative to the legacy PFAS perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS) which have been linked to numerous health effects.  This class of chemicals are incorporated into consumer products such as stain resistant carpeting and textiles, nanosprays, medical devices, and fire-fighting foams.  There is a high potential for occupational exposure and in the environment, PFBA has been detected in a variety of water sources leading to concerns for dermal exposure, however, these studies are lacking.  In previous studies from our lab, PFOA was demonstrated to be absorbed via the skin and immunomodulatory.  In the present study, the systemic toxicity of a 28-day dermal PFBA (3.75-15% w/v, or 93.8-375 mg/kg/dose) exposure was evaluated in a murine model.",N/A,0
1242,Projectile Fluid Penetration and Flammability of Respirators and other Head/Facial Personal Protective Equipment (FPFPPE),The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires surgical masks (SMs) and surgical N95 respirators used in healthcare to meet certain fluid resistance and flammability levels. NIOSH’s National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) investigated the fluid penetration and flammability of respirators and other head/facial personal protective equipment to determine their efficacy in reducing healthcare workers’ risk for occupational exposures to infectious microorganisms and injury due to accidental fires in surgical settings. The results from this study showed that FDA cleared SMs and surgical N95 respirators were resistant to synthetic blood penetration (Rengasamy et al. 2014) and met the flammability levels (Rengasamy et al. 2018) as expected. Seven out of eleven non-FDA cleared NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirator models also passed the synthetic blood penetration and flammability tests.

1243,Video-Based 3D pose estimation for residential roofing-dataset,"To protect residential roofing construction workers from both fatal and musculoskeletal injuries, it is necessary to assess the musculoskeletal and biomechanical risks in residential roofing tasks. This undertaking requires accurate information of workers’ 3D body positions to analyze kinematics and kinetics of the human body. In this study, we proposed a novel 2- stage motion estimation approach based on a convolution neural network to estimate residential roofer’s body positions using three-view video data. Instead of pursuing end-to- end training, our approach includes two stages: (1) use a multi-view model to estimate the 3D pose in a single frame; (2) use a multi-frame model to apply temporal convolutions to refine the multi-view outputs. The performance of the approach was evaluated by comparing our estimation with the gold-standard marker-based 3D human pose estimation (“ground truth”). The evaluation results show that our marker-free video-based approach can accurately capture the 3D posture of workers during the common roofing task and the proposed multi-frame model can effectively improve the precision of the coordinate sequence. The values of mean per joint position error of estimated human position before and after processing by the multi-frame model are 27.93 and 24.81 mm, respectively. These results prove that the proposed marker-free motion capture estimation approach can efficiently and accurately locate 3D body joints and pave the way for future onsite musculoskeletal motion analysis during roofing activities.",N/A,0

1245,Exposure to emissions generated by 3-dimensional printing with polycarbonate affects vascular morphology and expression of markers of oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in cardiac tissue,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing is increasingly being used in manufacturing settings, homes and schools.  Fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers are the most widely used systems with standard thermoplastics such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid and polycarbonate (PC) commonly used in the manufacturing processes.  Heating of the thermoplastic generates and releases particulates and fumes.  Emission constituents frequently measured include aldehydes, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes.  Inhalation of the emitted particulates and/or the fumes, that contain bisphenol A (BPA)  may pose health problems to users of these systems as well as bystanders.

The goal of the current study was to examine the effects of inhalation of PC-emissions generated during 3D-printing.  PC-emissions can include bisphenol A (BPA). Bisphenols are known endocrine and metabolic disruptors (i.e., they interfere with actions of steroid and thyroid hormones) and have been shown to have significant effects on a number of physiological systems including the endocrine and cardiovascular systems.  Because steroid hormones have major effects on cardiovascular function, it is possible that inhalation of PC particulate and/or BPA impact cardiovascular function.

To begin to understand how inhalation of PC-emissions generated during 3D printing might affect the cardiovascular system, the current study examined the effects of inhaling PC-emissions after 1, 4, 8, 15 and 30d of exposure, on peripheral vascular responses to vaso-modulating agents, on cardiac morphology and on the expression of proteins and transcripts that are markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and cardiovascular dysfunction.",N/A,0
1246,Testing the shock protection performance of Type I construction helmets using impactors of different masses,"Top impacts are considered essential tests to evaluate the shock absorption performance of commonly used type I industrial helmets. Currently, there are two major test standards that are widely applied in helmet industry: ANSI/ISEA Z89.1 and EN397.  Since drop impacts are performed using different impactors and at drop heights, results obtained using different test standards are not directly comparable. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate and compare the helmet impact test results obtained using these two frequently used helmet test standards. A representative basic Type I construction helmet model was selected for the study. A total of 19 drop impact tests were performed at different drop heights and with two different impactors (3.6 kg and 5.0 kg). Group (a) contains 10 drop impacts performed using the 3.6 kg  impactor at drop heights from 0.31 m to 1.93 m. Group (b) contains 9 drop impacts performed using the 5.0 kg impactor at drop heights from 0.22 m to 1.32 m. Each of the impact trials was replicated four times. Relationships between the peak impact force and the drop height for these two test groups were analyzed and compared. When the helmets were tested with potential impact energy smaller than critical values, a consistent trend for the relationship of peak impact force as a function of the potential impact energy was obtained. Our results show that our previously proposed quantitative evaluation approach for industrial helmets’ shock absorption performance can be used with either the ANSI/ISEA Z89.1 or EN395 standard to quantify industrial helmets’ shock absorption performance. Furthermore, our results illustrated that the peak impact force would not be a reliable parameter to evaluate the helmets’ safety margin.",N/A,0
1247,Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on N95 filtering facepiece respirators: implications for reuse,"In response to the shortage of N95® filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued strategies for extended use and limited reuse of N95 FFRs to conserve supply. Previously worn N95 FFRs can serve as a source of pathogens, which can be transferred to the wearer while doffing and donning a respirator when practicing reuse. To reduce the risk of self-contamination when donning and doffing reused FFRs, the CDC suggested storing FFRs for five days between uses to allow for the decay of viable pathogens including SARS-CoV-2. This study assessed the persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020 on N95 FFRs under controlled storage conditions for up to five days to inform the CDC guidance.",N/A,0
1248,Controlled Generation of Peracetic Acid Atmospheres for the Evaluation of Chemical Samplers,"The goal of the experimental design and research presented herein was to produce peracetic acid (PAA) atmospheres suitable for evaluating PAA sampling methods in a controlled environment. To achieve this, generated test atmospheres must: enable simultaneous exposure of multiple samplers to equivalent atmospheres; maintain a continuous stable atmosphere for a duration to exceed experimental time frames; and produce a range of analyte concentrations, air velocities, temperatures and humidities. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (AGCIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for PAA is 0.4 ppm. The goal was to generate PAA atmospheres with concentrations from one tenth of the TLV up to 100 times the TLV.

PAA is a reactive chemical, which presents some inherent challenges to generation of standard reference materials and atmospheres. PAA is a strong oxidant. PAA solutions are labile, thus it is difficult to keep reference standards or atmospheres. In solution, PAA and water are in equilibrium with acetic acid (AA) and hydrogen peroxide (HP). The equilibrium shifts as solutions of PAA evolve oxygen gas through the degradation of HP. Dynamic PAA atmospheres which are flowing and continuously refreshed are the preferred method for exposing samplers to equivalent atmospheres. Generation of static atmospheres by evaporating PAA solution into a closed container cannot be maintained for very long before needing to be refreshed. Dynamically generated atmospheres are created by a continuously renewed flow of air as a carrier and a source of PAA vapors, which are necessary for evaluating sensor performance over time frames relevant to occupational safety.

Generation of PAA vapors can be accomplished from assisted vaporization, including applying heat and/or aerosolization with a nebulizer to accelerate evaporation. Glass reacts with PAA to hydroxylate the silica. used a glass syringe to deliver PAA solution to a nebulizer; however, gas bubbles formed in the syringe leading to uncontrollable ejection of the PAA solution from the syringe. To mitigate this, used acid washed syringes. They generated atmospheres of up to 2 ppm with a reported 95% recovery of theoretical delivered PAA. Dilute solutions of PAA can help to mitigate gas evolution but require more energy to evaporate and introduce additional humidity.

For these experiments, PAA vapors were swept directly from the headspace above a PAA solution into our generation system. The flow rate of the air sweeping the headspace was varied to achieve the desired concentration after dilution into the carrier gas stream. When evaporating diluted PAA solutions using a nebulizer, the minimum humidity range is limited due to the water content in the dilute PAA solution. Thus, a wider humidity range on the low end is available when sweeping the headspace. The ability to maintain the concentration of PAA in the headspace above the solution is limited by the kinetics at the PAA solution-air interface. A practical solution was achieved using a PAA delivery system where air was passed through the headspace above a PAA solution in a vial. An impinger with a N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) analysis was used as the reference measurement for the PAA concentrations in the generated atmospheres.",N/A,0

• For any month’s coverage estimate, the denominator is the number of women with a pregnancy during the current flu season (defined as August through March) beginning before or during the specified month. The numerator is the subset of the denominator who have received flu vaccination prior to, during, or after pregnancy. The denominator increases as more women are identified as pregnant or having been pregnant during the flu season. Cumulative vaccination coverage for one month may be lower than cumulative coverage for a previous month due to addition to the denominator of women who are less likely to have received vaccination.",N/A,4
1250,"Efficacy of ventilation, HEPA air cleaners, universal masking, and physical distancing for reducing exposure to simulated exhaled aerosols in a meeting room-Dataset","There is strong evidence associating the indoor environment with transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 can spread by exposure to droplets and very fine aerosol particles from respiratory fluids that are released by infected persons. Layered mitigation strategies, including but not limited to maintaining physical distancing, adequate ventilation, universal masking, avoiding overcrowding, and vaccination, have shown to be effective in re-ducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within the indoor environment. Here, we examine the effect of mitigation strategies on reducing the risk of exposure to simulated respiratory aerosol particles within a classroom-style meeting room. To quantify exposure of uninfected individuals (Recip-ients), surrogate respiratory aerosol particles were generated by a breathing simulator with a headform (Source) that mimicked breath exhalations. Recipients, represented by three breathing simulators with manikin headforms, were placed in a meeting room and affixed with optical particle counters to measure 0.3–3 µm aerosol particles.",N/A,0
1251,Effects of antimicrobial chemical exposures on influenza vaccination and antiviral immunity,"Healthcare workers concurrently may be at a higher risk of developing respiratory infections and allergic disease, such as asthma, than the general public. Increased incidence of allergic diseases is thought to be caused, in part, due to occupational exposure to chemicals that induce or augment Th2 immune responses. However, whether exposure to these chemical antimicrobials can influence immune responses to respiratory pathogens is unknown. Here, we use a BALB/c murine model to test if the Th2-promoting antimicrobial chemical triclosan influences immune responses to influenza A virus. Mice were dermally exposed to 2% triclosan for 7 days prior to infection with a sub-lethal dose of mouse adapted PR8 A(H1N1) virus (50 pfu); triclosan exposure continued until 10 days post infection (dpi). Infected mice exposed to triclosan did not show an increase in morbidity or mortality, and viral titers were unchanged. Assessment of T cell responses at 10 dpi showed a decrease in the number of total and activated (CD44hi) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at the site of infection (BAL and lung) in triclosan exposed mice compared to controls. Influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were assessed using MHCI and MHCII tetramers, with reduced populations, although not reaching statistical significance at these sites following triclosan exposure. Reductions in the Th1 transcription factor T-bet were seen in both activated and tetramer+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lungs of triclosan exposed infected mice, indicating reduced Th1 polarization and providing a potential mechanism for numerical reduction in T cells. Overall, these results indicate that the immune environment induced by triclosan exposure has the potential to influence the developing immune response to a respiratory viral infection and may have implications for healthcare workers who may be at an increased risk for developing infectious diseases.",N/A,0

Exposure to triclosan has been positively associated with food and aeroallergy and asthma exacerbation in humans and, although not directly sensitizing, has been demonstrated to augment the allergic response in a mouse model of asthma. The skin barrier and microbiome are thought to play important roles in mediating inflammation and allergy and disruptions may contribute to development of allergic disease. To investigate potential connections of the skin barrier and microbiome with immune responses to triclosan, SKH1 mice were dermally exposed to triclosan (0.5-2%) or vehicle for up to 7 consecutive days.",N/A,0
1253,Effects of inhaled tier-2 diesel engine exhaust on immunotoxicity in a rat model:  A hazard identification study. Part III. Immunotoxicology,"Diesel exhaust (DE) is an air pollutant containing gaseous compounds and particulate matter.  Diesel engines are common on gas extraction and oil sites, leading to complex DE exposure to a broad range of compounds through occupational settings.  The US EPA concluded that short-term exposure to DE leads to allergic inflammatory disorders of the airways.  To further evaluate the immunotoxicity of DE, the effects of whole-body inhalation of 0.2 and 1 mg/m3 DE (total carbon; 6 h/d for 4 days) were investigated 1-, 7-, and 27-days post exposure in Sprague-Dawley rats using an occupationally relevant exposure system.  DE exposure of 1 mg/m3 increased total cellularity, number of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and B-cells at 1 d post-exposure in the lung lymph nodes.  At 7 d post-exposure to 1 mg/m3, cellularity and the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells decreased in the LLNs.  In the bronchoalveolar lavage, B-cell number and frequency increased at 1 d post-exposure, Natural Killer cell number and frequency decreased at 7 d post-exposure, and at 27 d post-exposure CD8+ T-cell and CD11b+ cell number and frequency decreased with 0.2 mg/m3 exposure.  In the spleen, 0.2 mg/m3 increased CD4+ T-cell frequency at 1 and 7 d post-exposure and at 27 d post-exposure increased CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell number and CD8+ T-cell frequency.  B-cells were the only immune cell subset altered in the three tissues (spleen, LLNs, and BALF), suggesting the induction of the adaptive immune response.  The increase in lymphocytes in several different organ types also suggests an induction of a systemic inflammatory response occurring following DE exposure.  These results show that DE exposure induced modifications of cellularity of phenotypic subsets that may impair immune function and contribute to airway inflammation induced by DE exposure in rats.",N/A,0
1254,Effects of E-Cigarette Flavoring Chemicals on Human Macrophages and Bronchial Epithelial Cells,"E-cigarettes utilize a wide range of flavoring chemicals whose respiratory health effects are not well understood. In this study, we used pulmonary-associated cell lines to assess the in vitro cytotoxic effects of thirty flavoring chemicals. Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and both naïve and activated macrophages (THP-1) were treated with 10, 100, and 1000 µM of flavoring chemicals and analyzed for changes in viability, cell membrane damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inflammatory cytokine release. Viability was most greatly affected by decanal, hexanal, nonanal, cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, vanillin, alpha-pinene, eugenol, and limonene. High amounts of ROS were elicited by vanillin, ethyl maltol, and the diketones (2,3-pentanedione, 2,3-heptanedione, and 2,3-hexanedione) from both cell lines. Naïve THP-1 cells produced significant levels of IL-1β, IL-8, and TNF-α when exposed to ethyl maltol and hexanal. Activated THP-1 cells released increased IL-1β and TNF-α when exposed to ethyl maltol, but many flavoring chemicals had an apparent suppressive effect on inflammatory cytokines released by activated macrophages, with varying degrees of accompanying cytotoxicity. The diketones, L-carvone, and linalool, suppressed cytokine release in the absence of cytotoxicity. These findings provide insight into patterns of cytotoxicity and inflammatory cytokine release potentially relevant to the development of pathological changes in the lungs of e-cigarette users.",N/A,0

The findings reveal that MWCNTs at a low dose (40 µg/mouse) and C60F at a high dose (>480 mg/mouse) stimulated acute neutrophilic inflammation, which exhibited rapid initiation and extended resolution. The lesion in MWCNT-exposed mice progressed to fibrotic granulomas by day 28 post-exposure, whereas it remained as alveolar histiocytosis in C60F-exposed mice.

1260,Applied force alters sensorineural and peripheral vascular function in an animal model of hand-arm vibration syndrome,"Working with vibrating hand tools is associated with the development of hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS).  HAVS is characterized by cold-induced vasospasms, finger blanching and changes in sensory function.  Vibration plays a major role in the development of the symptoms that are characteristic of HAVS, however, the hands and fingers of worker using tools are also exposed to pressure applied as the workers grip tools.  The pressure applied by gripping a tool might also affect blood flow and sensorineural function.  Therefore, this study examined the effects of applied pressure [2 and 4 newtons (N)] on peripheral vascular and sensorineural function using a characterized rat tail model.  The tails of rats were exposed to 0, 2 or 4N of applied force for 10 days.

1261,In vivo and in vitro toxicity of a stainless-steel aerosol generated during thermal spray coating,"Thermal spray coating is an industrial process where molten metal is sprayed onto a surface as a protective coat at high velocity. Using acellular, in vitro, and in vivo models, the toxicity of these aerosols was evaluated. An automated electric arc wire thermal spray coating aerosol generator and inhalation exposure system were developed to simulate an occupational exposure in an experimental model. Using the inhalation system, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to stainless steel PMET720 aerosols at 25 mg/m3 x 4 hr/d x 9 d. Lung injury, inflammation, and cytokine alteration were determined. Resolution of the response was assessed by evaluating these parameters at 1, 7, 14 and 28 days after exposure. The aerosols generated were also collected and characterized. Macrophages were exposed to 0 – 200 µg/ml of the collected particles to determine cytotoxicity and screened for known mechanisms of toxicity. Other metal particles similar in composition and morphology, gas metal arc (GMA-SS) and manual metal arc (MMA-SS) stainless steel, were used as particle controls. The influence of pressure used during the process on the toxicity profile of the generated aerosols also was assessed and found to be minimal. The PMET720 thermal spray coating particles exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity and membrane damage only at the highest dose tested. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) showed the PMET720 particles to have oxidative stress potential and caused a dose-dependent increase in intracellular oxidative stress. There also was a dose-dependent increase in NF-kB/AP-1 activity. Treatment with uptake inhibitors showed that the PMET720 particles were internalized via clathrin- and caveolar-mediated endocytosis as wells as actin-dependent pinocytosis/phagocytosis. In most of the cell assays, the two welding fume control particles generated a greater response compared to the PMET720 particles. In vivo, lung damage, inflammation and alteration in cytokines were observed 1 day after inhalation exposure, and this response returned to air control exposure levels by day 7. Alveolar macrophages retained the particulate even after 28 days after exposure. The results suggest that compared to stainless steel welding fumes, the PMET 720 aerosols were less potent, and the animals recovered from the acute pulmonary toxicity induced after 7 days.",N/A,0
1262,A Projectile Concussive Impact Model Produces Neuroinflammation in Both Mild and Moderate-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is as a major cause of death and disability experienced by nearly 3 million people annually resulting from falls, vehicular accidents, or from being struck by or against an object. While TBIs can range in severity, the majority of injuries are considered to be mild. However, TBI of any severity has the potential to have long-lasting neurological effects including headaches, cognitive/memory impairments, mood dysfunction, and fatigue as a result of neuronal damage and neuroinflammation. The goal of the study was to evaluate the neuroinflammatory and neuronal damage outcomes associated with mild or moderate-severe TBI via the modification of an established closed-head injury model of TBI by varying the material of the projectile.  Rats that received TBI using a stainless steel projectile exhibited outcomes strongly correlated to moderate-severe TBI, such as prolonged unconsciousness, impaired neurobehavior, increased risk for hematoma and death, as well as significant neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation throughout the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum.  In contrast, rats that received TBI with an aluminum projectile exhibited characteristics more congruous with mild TBI, such as a trend for longer periods of unconscious in the absence of neurobehavioral deficits, a lack of neurodegeneration and mild neuroinflammation.  Our results indicate that different levels of behavioral, neuroinflammatory, and damage outcomes are associated with differing levels of TBI severity.",N/A,0

The present study evaluated the systemic and immunotoxicity of sub-chronic 28- or 10-day dermal exposure of PFHxS (0.625-5% or 15.63-125 mg/kg/dose) in a murine model.  Elevated levels of PFHxS were detected in the serum and urine, suggesting that absorption is occurring through the dermal route.  Liver weight (% body) significantly increased and spleen weight (% body) significantly deceased with PFHxS exposure supported by histopathological changes. Additionally, PFHxS significantly reduced the humoral immune response and altered immune subsets in the spleen, suggesting immunosuppression.  Gene expression changes were observed in the liver, skin, and spleen with genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, necrosis, and inflammation.  Immune-cell phenotyping identified significant decreases in B-cells, NK cells, and CD11b+ cells in the spleen along with increases in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, NK cells, and neutrophils in the skin.

The Limit of Detection (LOD) for the glass and plastic impinger (0.24 mg/m3 (0.077 mg/L) and 0.28 mg/m3 (0.091 mg/L)), respectively, and Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) (0.79 mg/m3 (0.25 mg/L) and 0.92 mg/m3 (0.30 mg/L) for the glass and plastic impingers, respectively, are below the threshold limit value (TLV) short term exposure limit (STEL) of 1.24 mg/m3 (0.4 ppm) over a 15 minute period. This impinger method allows for a low cost, easy to use, and rapid in-field measurement for occupational exposure to PAA.",N/A,0
1266,Antimicrobials and Allergic Disease: Identifying Novel Biomarkers and Mechanisms of Action,"Occupational immune diseases are some of the most common illnesses that affect workers in the United States.  The Healthcare and Social Assistance Sector (HCSA) has one of the highest incidence of allergic disease compared to other industrial sectors. Individuals in this sector are frequently exposed to a variety of high-level cleaners and disinfectants along with antiseptics for the purposes of sterilization of surfaces, medical and surgical instruments, and reducing the incidence of nosocomial infections.  The range of specificity and effectiveness of these agents is very diverse based on the type of chemical used.  Commonly used antimicrobials include: alcohol, chlorine, iodine based agents; phenols; hydrogen peroxide; and quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC).   While the importance of these kinds of chemicals is understood, many of these agents are also known to directly contribute to allergic disease.  Antimicrobials including disinfectants and antiseptics are unique in that they have been identified to c",N/A,0

1268,"4,4’-Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate Exposure Induces Expression of Alternatively Activated Macrophage-Associated Markers and Chemokines Partially Through Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Mediated Signaling in Macrophages","Exposure to 4,4’-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), the most widely used monomeric diisocyanate, in the occupational setting may lead to the development of occupational asthma (OA). Currently, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI induces OA remain an active area of research. Alveolar macrophage dysfunctions play important roles in asthma pathogenesis. Upon exposure to outside stimuli, macrophages are polarized into either classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2) phenotypes. Macrophage polarization is associated with asthma development where M2 macrophage populations are usually pronounced in lungs of asthmatic patients. Recent in vivo studies demonstrated that M2 macrophage associated markers and chemokines were induced by MDI exposure, indicating that MDI may induce M2 macrophage polarization; however, the underling molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI causes induction of M2 associated markers and chemokines is unclear. M2 macrophage polarization can be regulated by activation of several M2 associated transcription factors; however, whether MDI exposure regulates these transcription factors is unknown. We hypothesize that MDI exposure induces M2 macrophage associate markers and chemokines through upregulation of M2 macrophage-associated transcription factors in macrophages. The first aim of this study is to verify whether MDI-exposure can induce M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokine expression that were observed in previous studies and to identify candidate M2 macrophage-associated transcription factors in response to MDI exposure that may account for the M2 macrophage polarization. After identification of the candidate transcription factor(s) that can be regulated by MDI-exposure, we investigate the roles of the candidate transcription factor in regulation of these candidate M2 macrophage associate markers and chemokines in relation to the exposure to MDI.",N/A,0
1269,Revealing the Structural and Chemical Properties of Copper-based Nanoparticles Released from Copper Treated Wood-Dataset,"Copper-based preservatives consisting of micronized and nanoscale copper particles have been widely used in applications for wood protection. The presence of micronized/nanoscale particles and soluble aqueous copper in copper-treated wood has raised questions regarding the forms of released particles and the potential hazards of exposure during the use of these products. However, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of these Cu species is limiting the future investigation of the toxicity of these materials and their potential health impact on workers. In this work, we used a combination of scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to analyze the particles released during the sanding/sawing of copper-treated lumber. We have demonstrated using EELS Cu L2,3 edges with comparative reference spectra to determine the Cu species. Three types of species, including basic copper carbonate (BCC), Cu(0), and Cu(II)-Wood complex, were identified in released wood dust particles. The unbound copper particles also exist as a form of BCC or reduced Cu(0). The morphologies and chemical states of emitted copper particles indicate the potential chemical transformation due to copper-wood interactions.",N/A,0
1270,Development of a thermal spray coating aerosol generator and inhalation exposure system,"Thermal spray coating involves spraying a product that is melted by extremely high temperatures and then applied under pressure under pressure onto a surface. Large amounts of a complex metal aerosol (e.g., Fe, Cr, Ni, Zn) are formed during the process, presenting a potentially serious risk to the operator. Information about the health effects associated with exposure to these aerosols is lacking. Even less is known about the chemical and physical properties of these aerosols. The goal was to develop and test an automated thermal spray coating aerosol generator and inhalation exposure system that would simulate workplace exposures. An electric arc wire- thermal spray coating aerosol generator and exposure system was designed and separated into two areas: (A) an enclosed room where the spray coating occurs; (B) an exposure chamber with different measurement devices and controllers. The physicochemical properties of aerosols generated during electric arc wire- thermal spray coating using five different consumable wires were examined. The generated particles regardless of composition were poorly soluble, complex metal oxides and mostly arranged as chain-like agglomerates and similar in size distribution as determined by MOUDI and ELPI. To allow for continuous, sequential spray coating during a 4-hr exposure period, a motor rotated the metal pipe to be coated in a circular and up-and-down direction. In a pilot animal study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to aerosols (25 mg/m3 x 4 hr/d x 9 d) generated from electric arc wire- thermal spray coating using a stainless-steel PMET720 consumable wire. The targeted exposure chamber concentration was achieved and maintained during a 4-hr period. At 1 d after exposure, lung injury and inflammation were significantly elevated in the group exposed to the thermal spray coating aerosol compared to the air control group. A thermal spray coating inhalation system was designed and constructed that will generate continuous metal spray coating aerosols at a targeted concentration for extended periods of time without interruption for future animal exposure studies.",N/A,0

Welding consumables devoid of Cr are being produced in attempt to limit worker exposures to potentially toxic and carcinogenic metals. The study objective was to characterize a copper-nickel (Cu-Ni) fume generated using gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and determine the pulmonary deposition and toxicity of the fume in mice exposed by inhalation. Male A/J mice (6 – 8 weeks of age) were exposed to air or Cu-Ni welding fumes for 2 (low deposition) or 4 (high deposition) hours/day for 10 days. Mice were sacrificed and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), macrophage function, and histopathological analysis were performed at various timepoints post-exposure to evaluate resolution. Characterization of the fume indicated that most of the particles were between 0.1 and 1 µm in diameter, with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.43 µm. Metal content of the fume was primarily Cu (~76%) and Ni (~12%). After exposure, BAL macrophages had a reduced ability to phagocytose E. coli at 1 and 7 days and lung cytotoxicity was evident and significant (>12-19% fold change). Loss of body weight was also significant at these two early timepoints. Lung inflammation, the predominant lesion identified by histopathology, was observed as a subacute response early that progressively resolved by 28 days with only macrophage aggregates remaining late (84 days). Future studies are planned to investigate the tumorigenic potential of Cu-Ni fume in A/J mice.",N/A,0
1273,Interleukin-11 Receptor Subunit Alpha-1 is Required for Maximal Airway Responsiveness to Methacholine After Acute Exposure to Ozone,"Interleukin (IL)-11, a pleiotropic, cationic cytokine, contributes to numerous biological processes, including adipogenesis, hematopoiesis, and inflammation.  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease, is notably characterized by reversible airway obstruction, persistent lung inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR).  Nasal insufflation of IL-11 causes AHR in wild-type mice while lung inflammation induced by antigen sensitization and challenge, which mimics features of atopic asthma in humans, is attenuated in mice genetically deficient in IL-11 receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL-11Rα1-deficient mice), a transmembrane receptor that is required along with glycoprotein 130 to transduce IL-11 intracellular signaling.  Nevertheless, the contribution of IL-11Rα1 to the manifestation of phenotypic features of non-atopic asthma are not presently known. Thus, based on the aforementioned observations, we hypothesized that genetic deficiency of IL-11Rα1 would attenuate lung inflammation and increases in airway responsiveness following acute inhalation exposure to ozone, a criteria pollutant and non-atopic asthma stimulus.",N/A,0
1274,Face mask fit modifications that improve source control performance dataset,"SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious respiratory virus that is primarily transmitted by respiratory aerosols and droplets emitted during activities such as talking, breathing, and coughing.  Because symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 can exhibit a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in their respiratory fluids, the CDC recommends that people wear a face mask that covers the nose and mouth to reduce community transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wearing a face mask to protect others from potentially infectious droplets, called source control, has been shown to be a highly effective infection control strategy to limit the spread of COVID-19.  The presence of mask face seal leaks enables respiratory aerosols to escape out rather than pass through the filtering materials of the mask, consequently reducing the benefits of wearing a face mask for source control.  As such, the current investigation examines various modifications that improve the fit of a medical or cloth face mask and reduce the amounts of expelled aerosols during simulated coughs and exhalations.",N/A,0
1275,Persisting Cryptococcus Yeast Species Vishniacozyma victoriae and Cryptococcus neoformans Elicit Unique Airway Inflammation in Mice Following Repeated Exposure,"Allergic airway diseases are a growing concern in industrialized nations and can be influenced by fungal exposures. Pathogenic yeast species such as Cryptococcus neoformans are known to exacerbate allergic airway disease. Recent indoor assessments have identified Basidiomycota yeasts, including non-pathogenic species such as Vishniacozyma victoriae (syn. Cryptococcus victoriae), to be prevalent and potentially associated with asthma. However, the pulmonary immune response to repeated V. victoriae exposure was previously unexplored. This study aimed to compare the immunological impact of repeated pulmonary exposure to pathogenic and non-pathogenic Cryptococcus yeasts. Mice were repeatedly exposed to either C. neoformans, V. victoriae, or PBS control, and the immune responses were analyzed by measuring histopathological scores, and quantifications of immune cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or lung via flow cytometry, and cytokine concentrations in the lung. These findings highlight the importance of in vivo characterizations of exposures to frequently detected fungal organisms.",N/A,0
1276,Potent Lung Tumor Promotion by Inhaled MWCNT,"In the lung, carcinogenesis is a multi-stage process that includes initiation by a genotoxic agent, promotion that expands the population of cells with damaged DNA to form a tumor, and progression from benign to malignant neoplasms. We have previously shown that Mitsui-7, a long and rigid multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), promotes pulmonary carcinogenesis in a mouse model. To investigate the potential exposure threshold and dose-response for tumor promotion by this MWCNT, 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) initiated (10 μg/g, i.p., once) or vehicle (corn oil) treated B6C3F1 mice were exposed by inhalation to filtered air or MWCNT (5 mg/m3) for 5 hours/day for 0, 2, 5, or 10 days and were followed for 17 months  post-exposure for evidence of lung tumors.",N/A,0
1277,β-defensin-1 regulates influenza virus infection in human bronchial epithelial cells through the STAT3 signaling pathway,"Understanding the host response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection is vital for developing intervention strategies. The primary barriers for invading respiratory pathogens are the airway epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and antimicrobial peptides produced by these cells. The antimicrobial peptide, β-defensin-1, has antiviral activity against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Significant downregulation of β-defensin1 gene (DEFB1) expression was observed when human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs) were exposed to IAV. HBEpCs overexpressing DEFB1 caused a significant reduction in IAV, that was confirmed by IAV matrix gene analysis and confocal microscopy. DEFB1expression after transfection with hsa-miR-186-5p and hsa-miR-340-5p provided evidence that DEFB1 expression could be modulated by these two miRNAs and hsa-miR-186-5p had a higher binding efficiency with DEFB1. Overexpression of DEFB1 in IAV infected HBEpCs led to increased NF-kB expression.  In a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) array analysis of 84 transcription factors, either overexpressing DEFB1 or siRNA silencing of DEFB1 expression significantly modulated the expression of STAT3.  In addition, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) integrated with PCR array data showed that the JAK1/STAT3 pathway was significantly altered by cells overexpressing DEFB1, suggesting that this may be one of the pathways by which defensin regulates IAV replication in HBEpCs. In conclusion, the reduction in IAV copy number in DEFB1 overexpressing cells suggests that β-defensin-1 plays a key role in regulating IAV survival through STAT3 and is a potential target for antiviral drug development.",N/A,0
1278,Evaluation of the fall protection of Type I industrial helmets,"Type I industrial helmets have been widely used at construction sites and by manufacturers as “general purpose” safety helmets. The performance of Type I industrial helmets for fall protection is not required to be tested in standardized tests. Chin straps and suspension system adjustment mechanisms are two important components of a typical industrial helmet, but the effects of proper use of them on the protective performance of Type I helmets have not been evaluated. The current study was designed to analyze the fall protection performance of Type I industrial helmets and to evaluate if the use of a chin strap and the suspension system tightness have any effect on protection performance. Head impact tests were performed by letting an instrumented manikin free fall backwards, from a standing posture, so that the manikin would make head-first contact with a solid surface of two different materials (concrete and plywood-covered). The results showed that all four tested helmet models demonstrated excellent performances for fall protection compared to the control group without wearing helmets. The fall protection performance of the advanced helmet models was substantially better than the basic helmet models. However, the effects of the use of chin straps and suspension system tightness on the helmets’ fall protection performance were statistically not significant. The findings of our study provide information to help construction companies and manufacturers better manage the use of Type I helmets for fall protection, thereby reducing work-related traumatic brain injury risks.",N/A,0
1279,"MicroRNA-Mediated Calcineurin Signaling Activation Induces CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, IL8 and Chemotactic Activities in 4,4’-Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate Exposed Macrophages","Occupational exposure to 4,4’-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), the most widely used monomeric diisocyanate, is one of the leading causes of occupational asthma (OA). Pathophysiological mechanism(s) by which how MDI causes OA is still warranted to be elucidated. Alveolar macrophages are the most abundant immune cell type in the lung, and these cells serve as one of the first immune responders against inhaled pathogens, particles, stimuli, and chemical allergens such as dNCOs. Upon encountering outside stimuli, alveolar macrophages react by phagocytosis as well as producing and secreting different mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and others, into the alveoli microenvironment to orchestrate the initiation of inflammatory/immune responses. Dysfunction of alveolar macrophages, including elevated production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other immune mediators, has been shown to play an important role in asthma pathogenesis. In the clinical setting, the levels of many immune mediators produced by macrophages have been found elevated in the asthmatic airway. However, both the levels of these asthma-associated, macrophage-secreted inflammatory/immune mediators in MDI-OA patients’ airways and how expression of these mediators change in response to MDI exposure in alveolar macrophages are largely undetermined. Previously, we demonstrated a microRNA (miR)-206-3p and miR-381-3p mediated PPP3CA/Calcineurin signaling induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) transcription in macrophages and bronchoalveolar lavage cells (BALCs) after acute MDI exposure; however, whether this mechanism participates in regulation of other asthma-associated mediators secreted by macrophages/BALCs after MDI exposure is currently unknown. The first aim of this study was to identify candidate asthma-associated, macrophage-secreted mediators that can be regulated after MDI exposure. After identified the candidate mediators can be regulated by MDI-exposure, we investigated the roles of miR-mediated calcineurin signaling in regulation of these candidate mediators’ expressions in relation to the exposure to MDI.",N/A,0
1280,Influenza virus induced novel miRNAs regulate the STAT pathway,"MicroRNAs are essential regulators of gene expression in humans and can control pathogenesis and host-virus interactions. Notably, the role of specific miRNAs during influenza virus infections are still ill-defined. The central goal of this study was to identify novel miRNAs and their target genes in response to influenza virus infections in airway epithelium. Human airway epithelial cells exposed to influenza virus induced several novel miRNAs that were identified using next generation sequencing (NGS) and their target genes by biochemical methods. NGS analysis predicted forty-two RNA sequences as possible miRNAs based on computational algorithms. Expression patterns of these putative miRNAs were further confirmed using RT-PCR in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) exposed to H1N1, H9N1(1P10) and H9N1 (1WF10) strains of influenza virus. A time course study showed significant downregulation of put-miR-34 in H1N1 and put-miR-35 in H9N1(1P10) infected cells, consistent with the NGS data. Additionally put-miR-34, and put-miR-35 showed a high fold enrichment in argonaute-immunoprecipitation compared to the controls, indicating their ability to form a complex with argonaute protein and RNA induced silencing complex (RISC), a typical mode of action found with miRNAs. Our earlier studies have shown that replication and survival of influenza virus is modulated by certain transcription factors, such as, NF-ĸB. To identify the target(s) of these putative miRNAs, we screened 84 transcription factors that have a role in viral pathogenesis. Cells transfected with mimic of the put-miR-34 showed significant decrease in expression of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3 (STAT3), and the inhibitor of put-miR-34 showed significant increase in STAT3 expression and its phosphorylation. In addition, put-miR-34 had 76% homology to the untranslated region (UTR) of STAT3. NGS and PCR array data submitted to the Gene Ontology also predicted the role of transcription factors modulated by put-miR-34. Our data suggests that put-miR-34 could be a good target for the antiviral therapy as the hyperactivation or inactivation of STAT3 results in viral disease, as tightly regulated STAT3 function is central to health.",N/A,0
1281,Developing a Solution for Nasal and Olfactory Transport of Nanomaterials,"Nanotechnology is one of the most rapidly developing areas of the economy and involves the study and control of matter in the nanoscale. The nanoscale is the size range from 1 to 100 nm. Recently, some nanomaterials have demonstrated the ability to enter the brain through the olfactory pathway from the nose to the brain. ⁠This pathway can potentially enable inhaled nanomaterials to enter the brain. Inhalation exposures are technically difficult and expensive. Intranasal instillation is a potential screening tool for evaluating nose to brain transport. However, particles in aqueous media tend to agglomerate and agglomerated particles often act like larger particles in terms of surface area, toxicity, and size thresholds for transport pathways. For neuronal transport within the brain, the upper size limit is estimated to be approximately 100 nm. Therefore, nanomaterials must be adequately dispersed in the vehicle used for instillation in order to evaluate their potential for transport from the nose to the brain.

Because 100 nm is the upper size limit estimated for transport within the central nervous system, components of dispersion media may need to be different from dispersion media used to evaluate toxicity in other tissues. For example, albumin, a protein which is useful in dispersion media developed for the lung, can interact with nanomaterials and increase their size. In addition, neurons transport sodium out of the cell, suggesting that a dispersion medium to evaluate nose-to-brain transport should avoid high sodium concentrations. To overcome issues with the size of albumin and other proteins as well as the potential effects of sodium and phosphate, we hypothesized that free amino acids, a balanced electrolyte solution, and a mixture of phospholipids could produce a solution that both dispersed nanomaterials and was compatible with neuronal transport. This study describes and characterizes a solution for nasal and olfactory transport (SNOT) that can disperse nanomaterials and dyes with nanoscale dimensions, enabling intranasal instillation so that potential nose-to-brain transport can be evaluated.",N/A,0

1283,Elevated muscle mass accompanied by transcriptional and nuclear alterations several months following cessation of resistance-type training in rats,"Loading-induced hypertrophy with transcriptional upregulation has been observed concomitant with nuclei accretion in various studies regarding both humans and rodents.   Bruusgaard et al. in 2010 pioneered work utilizing a model of synergist ablation to cause hypertrophy followed by denervation-induced atrophy to demonstrate that load-induced gains in myonuclei could be long-lasting after the termination of such exposure.  This finding was consistent with the idea of enduring myonuclear accretion as a form of “muscle memory” allowing enhanced muscle adaptation following a period of detraining.  Subsequent research groups further investigated this possibility in the context of exercise utilizing rodents and various loaded exercise paradigms such as weighted wheel running and ladder climbing.  This research yielded a spectrum of results.  While these studies were instrumental in highlighting the variation in outcomes possible following load-induced hypertrophy in general, they were limited in their direct relatedness to resistance training – the predominate form of exposure utilized to induce hypertrophy.  Our research group has established and repeatedly validated a rat research model to investigate resistance-type training.   The model is based on using a dynamometer to precisely expose dorsiflexor muscles of rats to 8 sets of 10 repetitions (per set) of stretch-shortening contractions (SSCs) – a consecutive sequence of isometric, lengthening, and shortening contractions.  Training with this exposure 3 sessions per week for one month results in increases in muscle mass and performance.  This is accompanied by an increase in muscle fiber area accompanied by a proportional increase in myonuclei number and a rise in overall transcriptional output as measured by total RNA levels.  The purpose of the present study was to determine to what extent alterations in performance, muscle mass, nuclei number, and transcriptional output persist several months following the termination of this relevant and valid model of resistance-type training.",N/A,0
1284,Biological effects of crude oil vapor. IV. Cardiovascular effects-Dataset,"According to the North American Industry Classification System, workers employed in the oil and gas extraction industry are working in one of three areas; 1) extraction, 2) drilling, or 3) processing and refinement (Bureau of Labor Statistics, April 15, 2014).  Both workers and people living in communities that are in close proximity to areas where gas and oil extraction and refinement occur have a higher incidence of respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, reproductive and nervous system disorders,

The goal of these studies was to identify mechanisms underlying the development of cardiovascular disease after inhalation of crude oil vapors (COV). The oil used for this study was a surrogate of the crude oil that leaked into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (McKinney et al., 2021). We tested the hypothesis that changes in cardiovascular function after inhalation of COV are manifested as changes in the responsiveness of the heart and peripheral vascular system to vasoconstricting and vasodilating agonists.  Based on previous studies, we also predicted that inhalation of COV would affect the expression of biomarkers of cardiac and kidney function that are associated with blood pressure regulation and disease.",N/A,0
1285,Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Induce Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase Expression and Enhance the Polarization and Function of M1 Macrophages in vitro,"Fibrogenic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) induce the polarization of M1 and M2 macrophages in mouse lungs. Polarization of the macrophages regulates the production of proinflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators (LMs) to mediate acute inflammation and its resolution in a time-dependent manner. Here we examined the molecular mechanism by which multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs, Mitsui-7) induce M1 polarization in vitro. Treatment of murine macrophages (J774A.1) with Mitsui-7 MWCNTs increased the expression of Alox5 mRNA and protein in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The MWCNTs induced the expression of CD68, and that induction persisted for up to 3 days post-exposure. The expression and activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase, an intracellular marker of M1, were increased by MWCNTs. Consistent with M1 polarization, the MWCNTs induced the production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, and proinflammatory LMs leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The cell-free media from MWCNT-polarized macrophages induced the migration of neutrophilic cells (differentiated from HL-60), which was blocked by Acebilustat, a specific leukotriene A4 hydrolase inhibitor, or LY239111, an LTB4 receptor antagonist, but not NS-398, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, revealing LTB4 as a major mediator of neutrophil chemotaxis from MWCNT-polarized macrophages. Knockdown of Alox5 using specific small hairpin-RNA suppressed MWCNT-induced M1 polarization, LTB4 secretion, and migration of neutrophils. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the polarization of M1 macrophages by Mitsui-7 MWCNTs in vitro and that induction of Alox5 is an important mechanism by which the MWCNTs promote proinflammatory responses by boosting M1 polarization and production of proinflammatory LMs.",N/A,0

Four BNNTs manufactured by the induction thermal plasma process allowed us to assess the influence of these residuals/impurities on the toxicity profile of BNNTs by producing a gradient of BNNT purity levels through sequential gas purification, and water and solvent washing, followed by filtration. Extensive characterization including Infrared, x-ray spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, size, charge, surface area and density allowed characterization of the alteration in physicochemical properties as the material went through sequential purification.

1288,Characterization of a multi-stage focusing nozzle for collection of spot samples for aerosol chemical analysis,"Concentrated collection of aerosol particles on a substrate is essential for their chemical analysis using various microscopy and laser spectroscopic techniques. An impaction-based aerosol concentration system was developed for focused collection of particles using a multi-stage nozzle that consists of a succession of multiple smooth converging stages. Converging sections of the nozzle were designed to focus and concentrate a particle diameter range of 900 to 2500 nm into a relatively narrower particle beam to obtain particulate deposits with spot diameters of 0.5-1.56 mm. A slightly diverging section before the last contractions was included to allow for better focusing of particles at the lower end of the collectable diameter range. The characterization of this multi-stage nozzle and the impaction-based aerosol concentration system encompassing the nozzle was accomplished both numerically and experimentally. The numerical and experimental trends in collection efficiency and spot diameters agreed well qualitatively; however, the quantitative agreement between numerical and experimental results for wall losses was poor, particularly for larger particle diameters. The resulting concentrated particulate deposit, a spot sample, was analysed using Raman spectroscopy to probe effect of spot size on analytical sensitivity of measurement. The method’s sensitivity was compared against other conventional techniques, such as filtration and aerosol focused impaction, implementing condensational growth.  Impaction encompassing the multi-stage focusing nozzle is the only method that can ensure high sensitivity at Reynolds numbers greater than 2000, that can be supported by small pumps which renders such method suitable for portable instrumentation.",N/A,0
1289,Biological effects of inhaled crude oil vapor VI. Altered biogenic amine neurotransmitters and neural protein expression,"In the oil and gas industry, workers are potentially exposed to crude oil or crude oil vapor (COV) during upstream (drilling and extraction), midstream (transportation and storage), as well as downstream (refining) activities.  Worker exposure to various fractions of crude oil have been linked to mortality, as well as musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, circulatory problems, and cancer.  During the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, response workers were exposed to a variety of chemical hazards including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals, as well as components of the oil dispersants employed to disperse the oil.  The Gulf Long-term Follow-up (GuLF) STUDY had reported that workers involved in the cleanup operations experienced adverse hematologic, pulmonary, hepatic, and cardiac problems.  However, long-term neurological effects remain unknown.

Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) surveys conducted by NIOSH among the cleanup workers identified a variety of health effects, including neurological symptoms.  Unfortunately, as a significant number of response workers who experienced health symptoms were exposed to both crude oil and the oil dispersant that was aerially sprayed to the contain the spill, the health effects of crude oil exposures alone were difficult to discern from these surveys.  It is here that laboratory-based studies are advantageous as they can provide ample health risk information to establish the toxicological potential of the various chemical hazards at the workplace.  To that end, the present work evaluated the neurotoxic risks of COV generated from the Macondo well crude oil that was used as a surrogate for the DWH crude oil.",N/A,0
1290,Examination of the exposome in an animal model: the impact of high fat diet and rat strain on local and systemic immune markers following occupational welding fume exposure,"The fundamental goal of this study was to develop an in vivo model of the exposome that could be used to evaluate exposure-induced alterations in local and systemic immune markers as a function of various exposomal factors. Accordingly, the model was designed to mimic an occupationally-relevant scenario in which inhalation of welding fumes (WF) constituted the primary occupational/environmental exposure of interest. Immune endpoints were assessed at three different time points representative of different stages in the exposure/response timeline (before WF exposure, directly after, and following a 12 wk recovery period). Moreover, the potential impact of genetic variation and lifestyle factors on the immune response to WF exposure and subsequent recovery was addressed by incorporating two different rat strains (Sprague-Dawley [SD] and Brown Norway [BN]) and two variations in diet (regular and high fat) into the model.

One of the primary objectives of this study was to determine whether consumption of a HF diet is associated with increased immunological responsivity following exposure to a common respiratory toxicant. The study was also executed with the goal of identifying which experimental factor (genetics/strain, diet, occupational exposure) is most influential in the modulation of local and systemic markers of immune status following WF exposure, and subsequently, the efficacy of inflammation resolution. The information obtained from these analyses will help elucidate which exposomic determinants may be particularly relevant in the context of immunotoxicity, and accordingly, warrant special attention in future investigations. The results will also contribute to the development of other in vivo exposome models and direct future efforts related to the exposome and its impact on human health.",N/A,0
1291,Evaluation of pulmonary effects of 3-D printer emissions from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene using an air-liquid interface model of primary normal human-derived bronchial epithelial cells,"This study investigated the inhalation toxicity of the emissions from 3-D printing with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) filament using an air-liquid interface (ALI) in vitro model. Primary normal human-derived bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs) were exposed to ABS filament emissions in an ALI for 4 h. The mean and mode diameters of ABS emitted particles in the medium were 175 ± 24 nm and 153 ± 15 nm, respectively.

1292,Quantification of mechanical behavior of rat tail under compression,"The development of vibration-induced finger disorders is likely associated with combined static and dynamic responses of the fingers to vibration exposure. To study the mechanisms of these disorders, a new rat-tail model has been established to mimic the finger pressure and vibration exposures. However, the mechanical behavior of the tail during compression needs to be better understood to improve the model and its applications. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the static and time-dependent force responses of the rat tail during compression. Compression tests were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley cadaver rat tails using a micromechanical testing system at three deformation velocities and three deformation magnitudes. Contact-width, and the time-histories of force and deformation were measured. Additionally, force-relaxation tests were conducted and a Prony series was used to model the force-relaxation behavior of the tail.",N/A,0

1294,Agreement of hip kinematics between two tracking marker configurations used with the 1 CODA pelvis during ergonomic roofing tasks,"The anterior and posterior superior iliac spine markers are commonly used to define the pelvis, and these markers are predisposed to occlusion during three-dimensional motion capture. The occlusion of these markers leads to the use of various tracking marker configurations on the pelvis, which can create differences in kinematic results. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the agreement of CODA pelvis kinematic results when two different tracking marker configurations were used during ergonomic roofing tasks. Three-dimensional motion data was collected on seven male subjects while mimicking a standing and kneeling roofing task. Hip joint angles were computed using the CODA pelvis with two different tracking marker configurations, the Trochanter Tracking Method (TTM), and the Virtual Pelvis Tracking Method (VPTM).",N/A,0
1295,Source Apportionment and Quantification of Liquid and Headspace Leaks from Closed System Transfer Devices via Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS),"Closed system drug-transfer devices (CSTDs) are devices which replace traditional needles, septa, and other connectors used for transferring hazardous drugs (HDs). NIOSH recommends using CSTDs to limit occupational exposure to hazardous materials and sharps when compounding and administering these drugs (NIOSH 2004). One of the engineering challenges associated with CSTDs is management of the headspace that is either compressed or displaced when transferring liquids in and out of drug vials. CSTD designs and components employing various technologies include creating a physical barrier to contain the displaced volume of air or filters to clean the displaced volume of air when transferring HD solutions. In 2015, NIOSH developed a protocol to test material containment of barrier type CSTDs (NIOSH 2015). NIOSH presented a plan to update the testing protocol so that it was applicable to both barrier and air cleaning types of CSTDs (NIOSH 2016). Both barrier type CSTDs and air cleaning type CSTDs may be susceptible to either liquid or headspace vapor leaks. Air-cleaning type CSTDs allow free passage of air but are expected to remove semi-volatile hazardous drugs (HD)s from the exiting airstream. Barrier type CSTDs have been designed to contain air rather than clean it, and it is reasonable to conclude that a headspace leak with a barrier type CSTD would contain the drug at the same concentration as the headspace inside the vial. As a result, the procedure described in this paper can adequately assess the efficacy of barrier type CSTDs based on the volume of liquid and headspace vapor leak measured. However, the volatile compounds used in this procedure will readily pass through an air-cleaning CSTD, regardless of the ability to retain a semi-volatile HD. Therefore, testing the efficacy of an air-cleaning CSTD requires coupling the procedure described herein with an assessment of the ability of air cleaning CSTDs to retain an appropriate semi-volatile surrogate when volumes of headspace containing that surrogate are passed through the CSTDs. The difference in the amount of HD contained in liquid versus headspace vapor leaks may be several orders of magnitude. The work presented herein is a test method that can distinguish the origin and volumetric quantity of liquid and headspace vapor leaked.

CSTD evaluation involves operation of CSTDs during normal use tasks, such as transferring a solution between two drug vials (NIOSH 2015). A test solution containing two volatile organic compounds (VOCs), acetone and methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), was used in the evaluation. Leaks were measured by detecting the VOCs in a glove chamber using Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS) as the detector. Liquid and headspace leaks are differentiated by the ratios of the two VOCs measured as a result of leaks from the CSTD. The compounds, acetone and MTBE, at equal concentrations in a test solution have a concentration ratio in the headspace vapor of the test solution that is very different, as predicted by their Henry’s constants. The ratio of acetone to MTBE detected in the glove chamber can be used to elucidate the source, liquid or headspace, and the magnitude of a leak. The analytical strategy is similar to stable isotope mixing models used to determine contributions from various sources by measuring isotopic ratios (Phillips and Gregg 2001). Propylene glycol (PG) was included in the testing solution as a surrogate for a HD component, though it was not quantified. Fluorescein was included as a visual qualitative indicator of a liquid leak location. SIFT-MS offers low limits of detection and real-time response. The real-time response has the benefit of enabling leaks to be temporally correlated with tasks involving manipulation of CSTD components.",N/A,0
1296,"DPM OC, EC and FT-IR data (Quantifying elemental and organic carbon in diesel particulate matter by mid infrared spectrometry).","A method for the quantification of airborne organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) within aerosolized diesel particulate matter (DPM) is described in the article cited below. DPM is a known carcinogen encountered in many industrial workplaces (notably mining) and in the ambient atmosphere. The method described here collects DPM particles onto a quartz fiber filter, after which reflection-mode infrared spectra are measured on a mid-infrared Fourier transform (FT-IR) spectrometer. Several infrared absorption bands are investigated for their efficacy in quantifying OC and EC. The thermo-optical (T-O) method is used to calibrate a linear regression model to predict OC and EC from the infrared spectra. The calibrated model, generated from laboratory DPM samples, is then utilized to quantify OC and EC in
mine samples obtained from two metal mine locations under a variety of operating conditions. The feasibility of further improving these results by partial least squares (PLS) regression was investigated. A single calibration that is broadly applicable would be considered an improvement over currently available portable instruments, which require aerosol-specific calibration.",N/A,0
1297,"Reduction of exposure to simulated respiratory aerosols using ventilation, physical distancing, and universal masking","The association between human respiratory disease transmission by respiratory droplets and aerosols is well established for several known pathogens.1 Given that the average individual spends > 90% of their day indoors, there has been intense focus on factors associated with indoor transmission. To minimize exposure risks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends behavioral and personal protective equipment mitigation strategies to limit COVID-19 transmission, including wearing masks, maintaining physical distances of  ≥ 1.8 m, and avoiding crowded indoor and outdoor spaces. As such, the current investigation examines the combined effect of physical distancing, universal masking, and ventilation on exposure to airborne particles generated during breathing and coughing within a controlled indoor environment. The results of this investigation quantitatively examine the contribution of the matrix of controls employed and provides guidance on respiratory disease mitigation strategies within the indoor environment.",N/A,0
1298,Exposure to the immunomodulatory chemical triclosan differentially impacts immune cell populations in the skin of haired (BALB/c) and hairless (SKH1) mice,"Workers across every occupational sector have the potential to be exposed to a wide variety of chemicals, and the skin is a primary route of exposure. Furthermore, exposure to certain chemicals has been linked to inflammatory and allergic diseases. Thus, understanding the immune responses to chemical exposures on the skin and the potential for inflammation and sensitization is needed to improve worker safety and health. Responses in the skin microenvironment impact the potential for sensitization and these responses may include the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, inflammasome activation, barrier integrity, skin microbiota, and the presence of immune cells. Selection of mouse strain to evaluate skin effects, such as haired (BALB/c) or hairless (SKH1) mice, varies dependent on the experimental design and needs of a study. However, dermal chemical exposure may impact reactions in the skin differently depending on the strain of mouse. Additionally, there is a need for established methods to evaluate immune responses in the skin. In this study, exposure to the immunomodulatory chemical triclosan was evaluated in two mouse models using immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and gene expression analysis.  The flow cytometry panel reported in this manuscript in combination with gene expression analysis may be used in future studies to better evaluate the effect of chemical exposures on the skin immune response.  These findings may be important to consider during strain selection, experimental design, and result interpretation of chemical exposures on the skin.",N/A,0
1299,Constant vs. cyclic flow when testing face masks and respirators as source control devices for simulated respiratory aerosols,"SARS-CoV-2 spreads by infectious aerosols and droplets expelled from the respiratory tract. Masks and respirators can reduce the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases like SARS-CoV-2 by blocking these aerosols and droplets at the source. The ability of source control devices to block aerosols can be tested by expelling an aerosol through a headform wearing the device. These tests may be performed using constant airflows, which are simpler, or cyclic airflows, which are more realistic but require more complex methods. The purpose of these experiments was to compare the results found using constant vs. cyclic airflows.

A source control measurement system was used to measure the efficacy of two cloth face masks, two medical masks with and without an elastic mask brace, a neck gaiter, and an N95 respirator as source control devices for simulated respiratory aerosols. With this system, the aerosol flows from the inside of the mask toward the outside; that is, the aerosol flows in the same direction as it would flow during an exhalation by a person wearing the source control device. The experiments were conducted under four airflow conditions: cyclic breathing at 15 liters/minute (L/min), cyclic breathing at 85 L/min, constant outward airflow at 15 L/min, and constant outward airflow at 85 L/min. Each experiment began by placing the source control device on the headform and performing a fit test. The measurement system collection chamber was then sealed, and the cyclic or constant airflow and the aerosol generation were initiated. The aerosol concentration in the collection chamber was measured using an optical particle spectrometer (OPS). The source control collection efficiency was determined by comparing the steady-state concentration of aerosol particles in the collection chamber when the source control device was worn with the concentration when no source control device was used.",N/A,0

Exposure to WBV has been associated with an increased risk for neck and back pain.  However, the findings of other studies have suggested that occupational exposure to WBV may also serve as a risk factor for the development of a number of diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the reaction products generated from gas-phase bleach oxidants and limonene, a fragrance compound commonly found in indoor air due to personal care products and cleaning products.  Gas-phase reactions were prepared in Teflon chambers housing HOCl, Cl2, and limonene.  The resulting chemical products were collected and analyzed using gas-phase preconcentration following by gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry.  Several chlorinated products were detected including a limonene chlorohydrin and limonene species containing one, two, and three chlorines.  Product concentration and yields were estimated for the most abundant products, and greater than 80% of the transformed limonene was represented in the detected products.  Temporal sampling of the reactions allowed time courses to be plotted for limonene transformation and chlorinated limonene product generation under different conditions including the treatments of HOCl/Cl2, Cl2 only, high vs. low relative humidity, and +/- ozone. These experiments provide additional insight into the chemical transformations initiated by sodium hypochlorite bleach oxidants in the gas phase which may be of interest to human health.",N/A,0

Recruitment of immune cells to the lung microenvironment via secreted chemokines by alveolar macrophages may play a role during asthma pathogenesis. Our prior study identified that alternatively activated (M2) macrophage-associated markers and chemokines were induced by MDI/MDI-Glutathione (GSH)-mediated Krüppel-Like Factor 4 (KLF4) upregulation in macrophages and induced chemotaxis abilities to naïve T-cells and eosinophils; however, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI upregulated KLF4 expression is unclear. Previously, we identified that two microRNAs (miRs) including hsa-miR-206-3p and hsa-miR-381-3p were significantly downregulated in MDI-GSH-exposed THP-1 macrophages. In silico analysis revealed that one hsa-miR-206-3p and two hsa-miR-381-3p predicted binding sites exist on the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of KLF4 transcripts. We hypothesize that MDI/MDI-GSH exposure induces M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokines through hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p mediated KLF4 upregulation in macrophages. The first aim of this study was to examine whether hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p regulates KLF4 expression in THP-1 macrophages through a posttranscriptional regulation mechanism. Our second aim was to determine whether hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p participates in KLF4-regulated M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokines after MDI-exposure. After identifying the role of endogenous hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p in regulation of KLF4 transcription factor after MDI-exposure, we investigated the role of hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p in regulation of M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokines’ expressions in relation to the exposure to MDI.",N/A,0

The “TCAC (Turbulent-mixing, Condensation Aerosol Concentrator)” is composed of a saturator for generating hot vapor, a mixing section where the hot vapor mixes with the cold aerosol flow, a growth tube where condensational droplet growth primarily occurs, and a converging nozzle that focuses the droplets into a beam. The prototype concentrator utilizes an aerosol sample flow rate of 4 L min-1. The TCAC was optimized by varying the operating conditions, such as relative humidity of the aerosol flow, mixing flow ratio, vapor temperature, and impaction characteristics. The results showed that particles with a diameter ≥ 25 nm can be grown to a droplet diameter > 1400 nm with near 100 % efficiency. Complete activation and growth were observed at relative humidity ≥ 25 % of the aerosol sample flow. A consistent spot sample with a diameter of D90 = 1.4 mm (the diameter of a circle containing 90 % of the deposited particles) was obtained regardless of the aerosol particle diameter (dp = 20 – 1900 nm). For fiber counting applications using phase contrast microscopy, the TCAC can reduce the sampling time, or counting uncertainty, by two to three orders of magnitude, compared to the 25-mm-filter collection. The study shows that the proposed mixing-flow scheme enables a compact spot sample collector suitable for handheld or portable applications, while still allowing for high flow rates.",N/A,0
1307,"Lung toxicity, deposition, and clearance of thermal spray coating particles with different metal profiles after inhalation in rats","Thermal spray coating is a process in which molten metal is sprayed onto a surface. Little is known about the health effects associated with these aerosols. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to aerosols (25 mg/m3 x 4 hr/d x 4 d) generated during thermal spray coating using different consumables [i.e., stainless-steel wire (PMET731), Ni-based wire (PMET885), Zn-based wire (PMET540)]. Control animals received air. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at 4 and 30 d post-exposure to assess lung toxicity. The particles were chain-like agglomerates and similar in size (310–378 nm). Inhalation of PMET885 aerosol caused a significant increase in lung injury and inflammation at both time points. Inhalation of PMET540 aerosol caused a slight but significant increase in lung toxicity at 4 but not 30 d. Exposure to PMET731 aerosol had no effect on lung toxicity. Overall, the lung responses were in the order: PMET885>>PMET540>PMT731. Following a shorter exposure (25 mg/m3 x 4 h/d x 1d), lung burdens of metals from the different aerosols were determined by ICP-AES at 0, 1, 4 and 30 d post-exposure. Zn was cleared from the lungs at the fastest rate with complete clearance by 4 d post-exposure. Ni, Cr, and Mn had similar rates of clearance as nearly half of the deposited metal was cleared by 4 d. A small but significant percentage of each of these metals persisted in the lungs at 30 d. The pulmonary clearance of Fe was difficult to assess because of inherently high levels of Fe in control lungs.",N/A,0
1308,Feasibility of a Selective Epoxidation Technique for Use in Quantification of Peracetic Acid in Air Samples Collected on Sorbent Tubes-Dataset,"The occupational exposure risk to peracetic acid (PAA), a common disinfectant and sterilant use in industrial settings like healthcare facilities and meat processing plants, is typically assessed through collection and analysis of atmospheric workplace samples. In this study, a new personal sampling technique was developed for determining the atmospheric concentration of PAA in the workplace. Samples of humidified air containing peracetic acid (concentration range: 25-2000 ppb) were collected on 350-mg XAD-7 solid sorbent tubes to adsorb the analyte. Peracetic acid was desorbed using anhydrous acetonitrile, after which it was treated with excess cyclohexene to generate the corresponding epoxide via the Prilezhaev reaction. The epoxide product was analyzed and quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, indirectly determining the amount of peracetic acid in the original air sample. The specificity for peracetic acid over other contaminants was assessed through a series of hydrogen peroxide (HP) and acetic acid (AA) spiking experiments, in which selectivity for PAA was demonstrated at several different concentrations of both HP and AA. The limit-of-detection (LOD) and the limit-of-quantitation (LOQ) for this method was determined to be 60 ppb and 198 ppb, respectively. Unlike many other methods, the sorbent tube negates the need for solvent in the sampling apparatus, adding to its ease of use. These features as well as inexpensive materials and the use of small, wearable vacuum pumps could allow for implementation of easier personal sampling in the workplace.",N/A,0

Recruitment of immune cells to the lung microenvironment via secreted chemokines by alveolar macrophages may plays important roles during asthma pathogenesis. Our prior studies identified MDI/MDI-GSH-exposure downregulates endogenous human/murine(hsa/mmu)-microRNA(miR)-206-3p, resulting in the activation of mmu/hsa-miR-206-3p-regulated signaling including KLF4-mediated signaling in MØs. The hsa-miR-206-3p-regulated signaling activation leading to induction of chemokines and chemotaxis activities of immune cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI/ MDI in the form of MDI-GSH conjugate exposure downregulated endogenous hsa-miR-206-3p expression is unclear. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in many different biological processes by targeting endogenous miRs, affecting protein translation and gene transcription in different cell types. The circRNA expression can be regulated via outside stimuli exposures; however, whether MDI-exposure influence circRNAs expression is unknown. Several circRNAs have been identified to regulate hsa-miR-206-3p levels through miR binding/targeting. We hypothesize that MDI-exposure induces endogenous circRNA(s) to regulate hsa-miR-206-3p in MØs.

1312,NanoSpotTM Collector for Aerosol Sample Collection for Direct Microscopy and Spectroscopy Analysis-Dataset,"We describe design and characterization of an aerosol NanoSpotTM collector, designed for collection of airborne particles on a microscopy substrate for direct electron microscopy, optical microscopy, and laser spectroscopy analysis. The collector implements a water-based, laminar-flow, condensation growth technique, followed by impaction onto an optical/electron microscopy substrate or a transmission electron microscopy grid for direct analysis. The compact design employs three parallel growth tubes allowing a sampling flow rate of 1.2 L min-1. Each of the three growth tubes consists of three-temperature regions, for controlling the water vapor saturation profile and exit dew point. Following the droplet growth, the three streams merge into one flow and a converging nozzle enhances focusing of the grown droplets into a tight beam, prior to their final impaction on the warm surface of the collection substrate. A miniscule sample deposition area is attained for effective coupling with microscopic and spectroscopic analysis. Experiments were conducted for the acquisition of the size-dependent collection efficiency, the uniformity of the spot deposit, the surface density distribution of the collected particles, and the aerosol concentration effect on the triple-tube NanoSpotTM Collector. Particles as small as 7 nm could be activated and collected on the electron microscopy stub. A spot deposit of approximately 0.7-mm diameter is formed for particles over a broad particle diameter range. The collected particle samples were analyzed using electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy for the acquisition of the particle spatial distribution, the spot sample uniformity, and the analyte concentration. Finally, the NanoSpotTM collector’s analytical measurement sensitivity for laser Raman analysis and the counting statistics for fiber count measurement using optical microscopy were calculated and were compared with those of the conventional aerosol sampling methods.",N/A,0
1313,Rat-Tail Models for Studying Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome:  A Comparison between Living and Cadaver Rat Tails,"Over-exposure of the hand-arm system to intense vibration and force over time may cause degeneration of the vascular, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems in the fingers. A novel animal model using rat tails has been developed to understand the health effects on human fingers exposed to vibration and force when operating powered hand tools or workpieces. The biodynamic responses, such as vibration stress, strain, and power absorption density, of the rat tails can be used to help evaluate the health effects related to vibration and force and to establish a dose-effect relationship. While the biodynamic responses of cadaver rat tails have been investigated, the objective of the current study was to determine whether the biodynamic responses of living rat tails are different from those of cadaver rat tails, and whether the biodynamic responses of both living and cadaver tails change with exposure duration. To make direct comparisons, the responses of both cadaver and living rat tails were examined on four different testing stations. The transfer function of each tail under a given contact force (2 N) was measured at each frequency in the one-third octave bands from 20 to 1000 Hz, and used to calculate the mechanical system parameters of the tails. The transfer function was also measured at different exposure durations to determine the time dependency of the response. The biodynamic responses of both cadaver and living rat tails, and the modeling results and time dependency are presented in a manuscript of this study (Warren et al., 2024), the original datasets measured in each trial of the tests are documented in this data description.",N/A,0

1316,Shoulder-Assist Exoskeleton Effects on Balance and Muscle Activity During a Block-laying Task on a Simulated Mast Climber,"Masonry work, a sub-specialty of the construction industry, consists of brick and block-laying. Masonry workers often perform these tasks daily using an elevated work platform (e.g., mast climbers). Mast climbers are elevating equipment used to replace traditional scaffolds. They have been available in the United States since the 1980s.  Mast climbers are capable of handling much greater loads of workers and materials than traditional scaffolding. They also make reaching greater heights much easier, thereby improving efficiency on construction projects. However, working on an unstable work platform at elevation can increase the risks of slips, trips and falls, including falls to a lower level. From 1990 to 2017, there were a total of 35 recorded fatalities associated with the use of mast climbers. Of the 35 fatalities, 13 were masonry workers (OSHA report).  Additionally, working on a mast climber can also create awkward working postures due to the confined nature of the workspace. Masonry work can be physically demanding. Concrete block can weigh between 9-27 kg. The rate of overexertion among masonry workers was 33.4 per 10,000 FTEs compared to the average rate of 21.5 per 10,000 FTEs in all industries (BLS data). Shoulder-assist exoskeletons present an attractive possibility to reduce MSD risks in masonry workers if the exoskeletons do not cause adverse effects to the workers’ stability and balance. 

In this study, we evaluated effects of three models of passive shoulder-assist exoskeletons on balance and shoulder muscle activity during a masonry task on a simulated mast climbing work platform. The balance-related parameters and shoulder muscle activities were compared when using or not using the exoskeletons. We want to evaluate the hypotheses that the exoskeletons (1) reduce shoulder muscle activity and (2) decrease the stability of the workers.",N/A,0
1317,"A High-throughput, Turbulent-mixing, Condensation Aerosol Concentrator for Direct Aerosol Collection as a Liquid Suspension","Trace measurement of aerosol chemical composition in workplace atmospheres requires the development of high-throughput aerosol collectors that are compact, hand-portable, and can be operated using personal pumps. We describe the design and characterization of a compact, high flow, Turbulent-mixing Condensation Aerosol-in-Liquid Concentrator (TCALC) that allows direct collection of aerosols as liquid suspensions, for off-line chemical, biological, or microscopy analysis. The TCALC unit, measuring approximately 12 × 16 × 18 cm, operates at an aerosol sample flowrate of up to 10 L min-1, using rapid mixing of a hot flow saturated with water vapor and a cold aerosol sample flow, thereby promoting condensational growth of aerosol particles. We investigated the effect of operating parameters such as vapor temperature, growth tube wall temperature, and aerosol sample flowrate, along with the effect of particle diameter, inlet humidity, aerosol concentration, and operation time on TCALC performance. Nanoparticles with an initial aerodynamic diameter ≥ 25 nm could grow to droplet diameters > 1400 nm with an efficiency ≥ 80%. Good droplet growth efficiency was achieved for sampled aerosol relative humidity ≥ 9%. We measured complete aerosol collection for concentrations of ≤ 3×105 cm-3. The results showed good agreement between the particulate mass collected through the liquid collector and direct filter collection. The TCALC eliminates the need for sample preparation and filter digestion during chemical analysis, thereby increasing sample recovery and substantially improving the limit of detection and sensitivity of off-line trace analysis of collected liquid samples.",N/A,0

1319,"Applied pressure alters circulating hormone levels and biomarkers of peripheral vascular, sensorineural dysfunction","Workers that regularly use vibrating hand tools as part of their job are at risk of developing hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS).  HAVS is characterized by cold-induced vasospasms that result in blanching of the fingers and hands, loss of sensation, pain, and reductions in manual dexterity, all of which can affect a worker’s ability to perform their job and their quality of life.  Vibration exposure significantly contributes to the development of these symptoms by increasing the stress and strain within exposed tissues, which in turn can affect functioning of blood vessels, nerves and sensory receptors in those tissues.",N/A,0
1320,Characterizing dynamic atmosphere generation system performance for analytical method development,"Laboratory-generated environments are substantial parts of the work involved in developing and validating methods for sampling volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in workplace atmospheres. We assessed the variability of samples produced by our dynamic atmosphere generation system designed for VOC generation and sampling. The characterization of bias and variability was conducted across various atmospheres containing pure n-heptane as well as mixtures of VOCs, which were collected using coconut shell charcoal tubes. The analysis of VOCs from these charcoal tubes was evaluated to reveal the variability from multiple sources: the generation of the atmosphere, the sampling process, and the analytical procedures. This research aimed to quantify the extent of variability from these sources and to estimate the sampling variability associated with our dynamic generation system. Our findings indicated that sampling variability ranged from 2% for pure n-heptane to 12% for a component within a ten-VOC mixture. Notably, sample variability increased with lower concentration levels and in mixtures compared to single-component atmospheres. This study provides a foundational reference for future experiments focused on atmosphere sampling performance at lower concentrations and in mixed VOC environments.

1321,Comparative in vitro toxicity of different thermal spray particulates in human bronchial cells,"Introduction: Thermal spray, in general, is a process that involves forcing a melted substance, such as metal or ceramic in the form of wire or powder, onto the surface of a targeted object to enhance its desired surface properties. In this paper, the melted substance is metal wire generated by an electric arc and forcibly coated on a rotary iron substrate using compressed air. This thermal process is referred to as double-wire arc thermal spray. The particles generated through these methods fall within the nanometer to micrometer agglomerate size range. There is concern regarding potential human health outcomes as these particles exhibit a similarity in particle morphology to welding fumes. Thermal spray wires with Zn (PMET540), Fe and Cr (PMET731), and Ni (PMET885) as primary metal compositions were used to generate particulate via an electric arc wire thermal spray generator for exposure to human bronchial cells (BEAS-2B) to examine comparative toxicity ranging from 0-200 µg/mL. Resulting cellular viability was assessed through live cell counts, and percent cytotoxicity was measured as a function of LDH release. Oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and alteration in Total Antioxidant Capacity were evaluated through DNA damage (COMET analysis) and antioxidant concentration at 0, 3.125, 25, and 100 µg/mL. Protein markers for Endothelin-1 (ET-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) were also assessed to determine inflammation and endothelial alteration.",N/A,0

1324,Release of Crystalline Silica Nanoparticles During Engineered Stone Fabrication,"Inhalation exposure to respirable crystalline silica (RCS) during fabrication of engineered stone-based kitchen countertops has been on the rise in recent years and has become a significant occupational health problem in the United States and globally. Little is known about the presence of nano-crystalline silica (NCS), i.e., particles below 100 nm. We present a methodology to quantify the crystalline silica content in the sub-100 nm size fraction of the aerosol released during engineered stone fabrication using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Aerosol was generated in test chamber designed per EN 1093-3 and sampled using cascade impactors. XRD and FT-IR analysis showed the presence of both α-quartz (15 – 60 %) and cristobalite (10 – 50 %) polymorphs in all size fractions. With increasing particle size, the cristobalite content increased. 70 % of the total aerosol mass in the sub-100 nm fraction was found to be crystalline silica, qualitatively confirmed by electron diffraction and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Presence of other minerals was detected in all size fractions; no polymeric resin binder was detected in the sub-100 nm fraction. Although, the sub-100 nm fraction was about 1 % of the aerosol mass, it accounted for 4 – 24 % of the aerosol surface area based on total lung deposition. If the surface area is a more relevant exposure metric, the assessment of efficacy of current engineering control systems using mass as an exposure metric may not provide adequate protection.",N/A,0
1325,Nerve agent exposure and physiological stress alter brain microstructure and immune profiles after inflammatory challenge in a long-term animal model of Gulf War Illness,"Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a disorder experienced by one-third of the veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf War, with symptoms including fatigue, chronic pain, respiratory and memory problems. Exposure to toxic chemicals during the war, such as oil well fire smoke, pesticides, physiological stress, and nerve agents, is thought to have triggered abnormal neuroinflammatory responses that contribute to GWI. Previous studies using animal models have indicated that combined exposure to high physiological stress and GW-relevant organophosphates, such as sarin nerve agent and chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos, produces neuroinflammation and changes in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures, suggesting a neuroimmune basis for GWI. In the current study, we examined brain structure and immune function of a chronic rat model of GWI and showed that a combination of long-term corticosterone treatment (CORT, to mimic high physiological stress) and diisopropyl fluorophosphate exposure (DFP, to mimic sarin exposure) resulted in elevations of multiple inflammatory cytokines, an increased activated microglial population, and disrupted brain microstructure in the hippocampal regions. Moreover, prior exposures to these agents modeling the “in-theater,” initiating exposure conditions experienced by veterans with GWI can induce long-term alterations in neuroimmune signaling, resulting in an exacerbated neuroinflammatory response to future immune challenges.  The goal of the study was to establish a long-term model of GWI in rats that would be more relevant to the current state of ill veterans.  As such, rats were initially exposed to the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) for 1 week followed by a single exposure to the sarin surrogate diisopropyl fluorophosphate, to mimic “in-theater” conditions of high physiological stress and nerve agent exposure.  This initial exposure was followed up with 4 weeks of intermittent re-exposure to week-long bouts of CORT and a final exposure to the prototypical inflammagen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic a systemic inflammatory challenge.",N/A,0
1326,Inconsequential Role for Chemerin-Like Receptor 1 in a Manifestation of Ozone-Induced Lung Pathophysiology in Male Mice,"Chemerin, a non-chemokine chemoattractant, and resolvin E1 (RvE1), a specialized pro-resolving lipid mediator, are endogenous ligands for chemerin-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), a Gi/o protein-coupled receptor expressed by leukocytes and non-leukocytes.  In mice, exogenous administration of chemerin or RvE1 diminishes the severity of lung inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) induced by antigen sensitization and challenge, which mimics phenotypic features of atopic asthma in humans.  However, the contribution of chemerin or RvE1 to features of non-atopic asthma is unknown.  Therefore, to indirectly assess if chemerin or RvE1 facilitates development of a non-atopic asthma phenotype, which includes AHR to acetyl-β-methylcholine chloride, lung hyperpermeability, airway epithelial cell desquamation, and lung inflammation, we quantified features of these sequelae in wild-type mice and mice failing to express CMKLR1 (CMKLR1-deficient mice) following cessation of acute inhalation exposure to either filtered room air or ozone, a criteria pollutant and non-atopic asthma stimulus.",N/A,0
1327,"Assessment of Filtration Efficiency, Manikin Fit Performance, and Strap Performance for Decontaminated N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators","Supplies of N95® filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) can become depleted during widespread outbreaks of infectious respiratory illnesses. To supplement the national inventory of NIOSH Approved® N95 FFRs during times of extreme shortages, FFR reuse following decontamination is a possible strategy. Decontamination is a process to reduce the number of pathogens on used FFRs before reuse. An effective FFR decontamination technique should significantly reduce the pathogen burden, but not reduce a respirator’s filtration performance or its ability to fit properly. Another consideration is that no hazardous chemical residue should be left on the FFR following the decontamination process.",N/A,0
1328,Applied force alters sensorineural and peripheral vascular function in an animal model of hand-arm vibration syndrome,"Working with vibrating hand tools is associated with the development of hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS).  HAVS is characterized by cold-induced vasospasms, finger blanching and changes in sensory function.  Vibration plays a major role in the development of the symptoms that are characteristic of HAVS, however, the hands and fingers of worker using tools are also exposed to pressure applied as the workers grip tools.  The pressure applied by gripping a tool might also affect blood flow and sensorineural function.  Therefore, this study examined the effects of applied pressure [2 and 4 newtons (N)] on peripheral vascular and sensorineural function using a characterized rat tail model.  The tails of rats were exposed to 0, 2 or 4N of applied force for 10 days.  Blood flow (laser doppler) and sensitivity of the tail to pressure (Randall-Selitto pressure test) was measured on days 1, 5 and 10 of the exposure.  The sensitivity of the tail nerves to electrical stimulation was measured on days 2 and 9.",N/A,0
1329,Glove Performance Dermal Absorption of Fentanyl,"With the increase in opioid sales on the illicit drug market and overdoses, opioid incidents and exposure risk are concerns for first responders, including law enforcement officers. To prevent dermal, mucosal, or inhalation exposure to opioids and other hazardous drugs, first responders rely on personal protective equipment (PPE) – including respirators and gloves – as their last line of defense within the hierarchy of controls. NIOSH, in response to requests from first responders concerning appropriate glove selection (e.g., glove material, thickness), recommended for minimal and moderate anticipated opioid exposures powder-free nitrile gloves with a minimum thickness of 5 ± 2 mil (i.e., 0.13 ± 0.05 millimeters [mm]). Some glove manufacturers have recently marketed their gloves claiming fentanyl protection. There is limited empirical PPE performance data for opioids, and no industry standard or test method currently exists for evaluating PPE performance against opioids. The purpose of this study was to provide this empirical data under conditions representative of those encountered in the field to support (1) NIOSH’s current opioid PPE recommendations and (2) industry standards and test methods.",N/A,0

1331,Evaluation of A Passive Back-Support Exoskeleton in Bed-to-Chair Patient Handling Tasks,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a passive back-support exoskeleton on the physical demands of caregivers during bed-to-chair patient handling tasks. Eight participants (5 males and 3 females) performed 4 different patient handling tasks, including 1) lying to sitting, 2) sitting to standing, 3) standing to sitting, and 4) bed to wheelchair transfer with and without the exoskeleton. In certain bed-to-chair patient handling tasks, the exoskeleton (Laevo V2.5) was found to significantly reduce the peak and median values of the hip flexion angles and muscle activities of erector spinae compared to no exoskeleton. The effect of the exoskeleton was task-dependent. The exoskeleton caused a greater reduction of the erector spinae muscle activities of symmetric exertions than the asymmetric exertions. With the exoskeleton, participants adjusted their patient handling strategies by decreasing the hip flexion but increasing the trunk extension. There was a lack of significant changes in the heart rate with the exoskeleton.  The results suggest that back-support exoskeletons could play a role in reducing the muscular demand of the low back during certain bed-to-chair patient handling tasks. However, further research would be needed to fully assess its effectiveness and practicality in improving patient-handling techniques.",N/A,0
1332,Phase Level Assessment of Ergonomic Intervention Effectiveness in Reducing Knee Musculoskeletal Disorder Risks during Residential Roof Shingle Installation,"The prevalence of knee musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among roofers due to ergonomically unfavorable kneeling postures during shingle installation is a well-recognized concern. While knee-saving interventions like knee savers (KSs) and knee pads (KPs) have shown potential to reduce MSD risks, their effectiveness across different phases of shingle installation remains unknown. The objective of this study is to assess how interventions of KSs and KPs alleviate risks of MSDs in the knees during various phases of shingle installation. These phases encompass (1) reaching for shingles, (2) placing shingles, (3) grabbing a nail gun, (4) moving to the first nailing position, (5) nailing shingles, (6) replacing the nail gun, and (7) returning to an upright position. To collect data, nine male participants simulated the shingle installation task on a slope-adjustable roof platform (0°, 15°, and 30° slopes) under four intervention conditions: no intervention (NO), with KPs only (KP), with KSs only (KS), and with both KPs and KSs (BO) in a laboratory setting. Knee parameters including maximum flexion, abduction, adduction, and internal/external rotations were measured at all phases to assess intervention impacts through statistical analysis.",N/A,0
