# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This text serves as guide through the disciplines of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Data Science, with an overarching theme of health equity. It is partitioned into three parts, each dedicated to one of these integral fields of study, and meticulously interwoven with practical R and Python applications.

Part I: Biostatistics furnishes a foundation in statistical theory and methods. Beginning with probability and progressing through to more sophisticated inferential techniques, this section emphasizes the statistical underpinnings required for robust health research.

Part II: Epidemiology addresses the distribution and determinants of health-related states in populations. Here, we examine various study designs and their role in identifying factors that influence health outcomes, always with a lens focused on the wider implications for public health.

Part III: Data Science introduces the latest computational strategies for handling vast datasets characteristic of contemporary health research. The integration of data science with traditional statistical approaches is demonstrated through tangible coding exercises.

The book's structure is intended to guide readers from fundamental concepts to more complex, integrative approaches. Each part is designed not only to inform but also to equip the reader with the analytical skills necessary for contributing to the advancement of health equity in an era of data-rich research.
