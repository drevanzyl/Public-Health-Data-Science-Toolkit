Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts.

Several data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts. Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Provisional data presented will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.

CDC's national genomic surveillance system collects SARS-CoV-2 specimens for sequencing through the National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance (NS3) program, as well as SARS-CoV-2 sequences generated by commercial or academic laboratories contracted by CDC and state or local public health laboratories. Viral genomic sequences are analyzed and classified as a particular variant. The proportions of variants in a population are estimated nationally, by HHS region, and by jurisdiction. The thousands of sequences analyzed every week through CDC’s national genomic sequencing and bioinformatics efforts fuel this comprehensive and population-based U.S. surveillance system established to identify and monitor the spread of variants.

The data is grouped by different time periods including 3-month period, weekly, and total (cumulative since January 1, 2020). United States death counts and rates include the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia and New York City. New York state estimates exclude New York City. Puerto Rico is included in HHS Region 2 estimates.

Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1. Number of deaths reported in this file are the total number of COVID-19 deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and may not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Counts of deaths occurring before or after the reporting period are not included in the file.

Data during recent periods are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.

Death counts should not be compared across states. Data timeliness varies by state. Some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly. 

The ten (10) United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New Jersey, New York, New York City, Puerto Rico; Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.

Rates were calculated using the population estimates for 2021, which are estimated as of July 1, 2021 based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census PL 94-171 Redistricting File (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/methods-statement-v2021.pdf).

Rates are based on deaths occurring in the specified week/month and are age-adjusted to the 2000 standard population using the direct method (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-08-508.pdf). These rates differ from annual age-adjusted rates, typically presented in NCHS publications based on a full year of data and annualized weekly/monthly age-adjusted rates which have been adjusted to allow comparison with annual rates.  Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly/monthly) rate prevailed for a full year.

Sub-national death counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS data confidentiality standards. Rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS standards of reliability as specified in NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions (available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdf.).",10682,175

Percentages of deaths with a cause of death pending further investigation and a note on historical completeness (e.g. if the percent completeness was under 90% after 6 months) are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical Notes). Counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS confidentiality standards. Provisional data presented on this page will be updated on a quarterly basis as additional records are received.

Technical Notes

Nature and Sources of Data

Provisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from the state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).

The timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death and jurisdiction in which the death occurred. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death due to the time often needed to investigate these deaths (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.

Provisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for “12 month-ending periods,” defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12 month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12 month-ending period in June 2020 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. The 12 month-ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12 month-ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation.

Cause of Death Classification and Definition of Drug Deaths

Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with the World Health Organizations (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regul",8077,44

The dataset contains a weekly summary of aggregate counts of the total SARS-CoV-2 tests and SARS-CoV-2 detections reported to NREVSS since March 14, 2020. These data are reported weekly on a voluntary basis. Clinical laboratories do not report demographic data through NREVSS. Testing practices may vary regionally, and the number of participating laboratories may change from year to year. Results can be changed for up to 2 years after the initial reporting week. However, discrepancies may be noted and updated at the discretion of the data stewards and key stakeholders.

While NREVSS strives to present the most precise estimates of respiratory viral trends with reporting burden minimized for participating laboratories, there are several inherent limitations to this surveillance system.

NREVSS does not collect patient-specific data or demographic information. Multiple samples may be collected from a single patient, so NREVSS results do not necessarily reflect the number of patients tested, nor do they directly reflect hospitalizations or deaths related to COVID-19.

Participating laboratories vary in size, testing capabilities, and areas served. Some institutions may receive and test samples from sites across a given state or even from multiple states. Without direct knowledge of the population base, NREVSS cannot be used to determine the prevalence or incidence of infection.

For more information on NREVSS and COVID-19 surveillance please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss. These data appear starting May 25, 2023 on the CDC COVID Data Tracker at the following URLs: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends ; https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases.   

NREVSS data are reported at the national and HHS regional levels. The ten (10) U.S. Department of HHS regions are defined here: https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/regional-offices/index.html. 

The data represent SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) results, which include reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests from a voluntary, sentinel network of participating laboratories in the United States, including clinical, public health and commercial laboratories (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/labs/index.html). 

These data exclude antigen, antibody, and at-home test results. 

All data are provisional and subject to change. Reporting is less complete for the past 1 week, and more complete (>90%) for the period 2 weeks earlier. 

There are data from all states across the 10 HHS regions. Because the data are from a sentinel network of laboratories, however, results may vary geographically. The data do not include all test results within a jurisdiction and therefore do not reflect all SARS-CoV-2 NAATs administered in the United States. 

Percent positivity is one of the surveillance metrics used to monitor COVID-19 transmission over time and by area. Percent positivity is calculated by dividing the number of positive NAATs by the total number of NAATs administered, then multiplying by 100 [(# of positive NAAT tests / total NAAT tests) x 100].

The data represent laboratory tests performed, not individual (deduplicated) results in people. In the table and upon hovering on the map, the total test counts in the data reflect the latest data reported from NREVSS laboratories and may not match the data presented by various jurisdictions.

On May 11, 2023, CDC discontinued utilizing the COVID electronic laboratory reporting (CELR) platform as the primary laboratory source of COVID-19 results. These data are archived at health.data.gov.

Provisional rates which are an early estimate of the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, are shown as of the date specified and may not include all deaths and births that occurred during a given time period (see Technical Notes).

A maternal death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes. In this data visualization, maternal deaths are those deaths with an underlying cause of death assigned to International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code numbers A34, O00–O95, and O98–O99.

The provisional data  include reported 12 month-ending provisional maternal mortality rates overall, by age, and by race and Hispanic origin. Provisional maternal mortality rates presented in this data visualization are for “12-month ending periods,” defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2020 would include deaths and births occurring from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020. Evaluation of trends over time should compare estimates from year to year (June 2020 and June 2021), rather than month to month, to avoid overlapping time periods. In the visualization and in the accompanying data file, rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with current NCHS standards of reliability for rates. Death counts between 1-9 in the data file are suppressed in accordance with National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) confidentiality standards.

Provisional data presented on this page will be updated on a quarterly basis as additional records are received. Previously released estimates are revised to include data and record updates received since the previous release. As a result, the reliability of estimates for a 12-month period ending with a specific month will improve with each quarterly release and estimates for previous time periods may change as new data and updates are received.",6075,53

The data contain weekly, aggregate counts of RSV tests performed and RSV detections as reported to NREVSS since April 11, 2020. 

NREVSS data are reported weekly at the national and 10 HHS regional levels (https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/regional-offices/index.html). The presented data are RSV Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) results, which include reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. These data exclude antigen, antibody, and at-home test results. Less than 5% of RSV tests reported to NREVSS are from antigen tests. All data are provisional and subject to change. Reporting is less complete for the most recent weeks, but relatively complete (>90%) for the period up to 2 weeks earlier. 

Percent positivity is a surveillance metric used to monitor RSV activity over time and by geographic area. Participating laboratories send weekly reports of the total number of RSV tests performed that week, and the number of those tests that were positive. In the table and upon hovering on the map, the total test counts reflect the latest data reported to NREVSS and may differ from data presented by public health jurisdictions. Public health jurisdictions may have additional data not reported to NREVSS and may use a different reporting cadence. The RSV trend graphs display the weekly average percent of tests positive for RSV among all the tests performed. Each point on the regional table displays the average number of RSV tests that were performed, and the average percent of those that were positive during a 3-week period (i.e., the specified week, and the weeks immediately preceding and following it). This is also known as a centered, 3-week moving average. The RSV detections displayed are the 5-week moving average (average of the 4 previous and current weeks) in accordance with the recommendations for assessing RSV trends by detections (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/216/3/345/3860464). 

NREVSS strives to present precise estimates of respiratory viral trends and minimize reporting burden for participating laboratories. However, there are several limitations to this surveillance system. NREVSS is a laboratory-based surveillance system that does not have patient-specific data; multiple tests from a single patient may be included. In addition, NREVSS does not collect demographic or clinical data (i.e., hospitalizations or deaths). Testing practices may vary regionally, and the number of participating laboratories may change from year to year. Laboratories from all 50 states report data weekly, but reporting is voluntary and may not be representative of local RSV activity. The data do not include all test results within a jurisdiction and therefore do not reflect all RSV NAATs administered regionally or nationally.

This dataset provides the percentage of emergency department patient visits for the specified pathogen of all ED patient visits for the specified geographic part of the country that were observed for the given week from data submitted to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). In addition, the trend over time is characterized as increasing, decreasing or no change, with exceptions for when there are no data available, the data are too sparse, or there are not enough data to compute a trend. These data are to provide awareness of how the weekly trend is changing for the given geographic region.  

Note that the reported sub-state trends are from Health Service Areas (HSA) and the data reported from the health care facilities located within the given HSA. Health Service Areas are regions of one or more counties that align to patterns of care seeking. The HSA level data are reported for each county in the HSA. 

More information on HSAs is available <a href=""https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/countyattribs/hsa.html""><b>here</b></a>.

For the emergency department time series, trajectory classifications reported on for sub-state (HSA) emergency department time series, trajectory classifications are based on approximations of the first derivative (slope) of trends that are smoothed using generalized additive models (GAMs). To determine time intervals in which the slope is sufficiently changing (i.e., rate of change distinguishable from 0), 95% confidence intervals for the slope approximations are calculated and assessed. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval not containing 0 are classified as increasing if the slope estimate is positive and decreasing if the slope estimate is negative. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval containing 0 are classified as stable. In the scenario that an HSA's time series is determined to be too sparse (i.e., many weeks with percentages of 0%), a model is not fit, and the HSA is classified as “sparse”.

United States death counts and rates include the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.

Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1. Number of deaths reported in this file are the total number of COVID-19 deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and may not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Counts of deaths occurring before or after the reporting period are not included in the file.

Data during recent periods are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.

Death counts should not be compared across jurisdictions. Data timeliness varies by state. Some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly.

The ten (10) United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New Jersey, New York; Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.

Rates were calculated using the population estimates for 2021, which are estimated as of July 1, 2021 based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census PL 94-171 Redistricting File (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/methods-statement-v2021.pdf).

Rate are based on deaths occurring in the specified week and are age-adjusted to the 2000 standard population using the direct method (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-08-508.pdf). These rates differ from annual age-adjusted rates, typically presented in NCHS publications based on a full year of data and annualized weekly age-adjusted rates which have been adjusted to allow comparison with annual rates. Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly) rate prevailed for a full year.

Sub-national death counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS data confidentiality standards. Rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS standards of reliability as specified in NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions (available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdf.).",1896,75

Specific drugs were identified using methods for searching literal text from death certificates. 

The provisional data are based on a current flow of mortality data and include reported 12 month-ending provisional counts of drug overdose deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence and specified drug. Provisional drug overdose death counts presented on this page are for “12-month ending periods,” defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2022 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022. Evaluation of trends over time should compare estimates from year to year (June 2021 and June 2022), rather than month to month, to avoid overlapping time periods. It is important to note that the data represent counts of deaths, and not mortality ratios or rates, which are the standard measure used to compare groups, and therefore should not be used to determine populations at disproportionate risk of drug overdose death.",1873,18

The program funding information is as follows: The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (P.L. 116-136), appropriated $100 billion to reimburse eligible health care providers for health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus. The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act or PPPHCEA (P.L. 116-139) appropriated an additional $75 billion for relief funds, and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act appropriated an additional $3 billion.  HRSA established the Provider Relief Fund (PRF) to administer payments to eligible providers. A portion of the PRF funds are being used to provide reimbursement to providers for administering Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized COVID-19 vaccines under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or FDA-licensed COVID-19 vaccines under a Biologics License Application (BLA) to underinsured individuals.

This dataset represents COVID-19 hospitalization data and metrics aggregated to county or county-equivalent, for all counties or county-equivalents (including territories) in the United States as of the initial date of reporting for each weekly metric. COVID-19 hospitalization data are reported to CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network, which monitors national and local trends in healthcare system stress, capacity, and community disease levels for approximately 6,000 hospitals in the United States.

The weekly cumulatve COVID-19 –associated hospitalization estimates are preliminary, and use reported weekly hospitalizations among laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. The data are updated week-by-week as new COVID-19 hospitalizations are reported to CDC from the COVID-NET system and include both new admissions that occurred during the reporting week, as well as those admitted in previous weeks that may not have been included in earlier reporting. Each week CDC estimates a range (i.e., lower estimate and an upper estimate) of COVID-19 -associated hospitalizations that have occurred since October 1, 2024. For details, please refer to the publication [7]. 
 
<b>Note:</b> Data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Rates for recent COVID-19-associated hospital admissions are subject to reporting delays; as new data are received each week, previous rates are updated accordingly.

Estimates are preliminary, and use reported weekly hospitalizations among laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. The data are updated week-by-week as new RSV-associated hospitalizations are reported to CDC from the RSV-NET surveillance system and include both new admissions that occurred during the reporting week, as well as those admitted in previous weeks that may not have been included in earlier reporting. Each week CDC estimates a range (i.e., lower estimate and an upper estimate) of RSV-associated hospitalizations that have occurred since October 1, 2024. For details, please refer to the publication [7].  

<b>Note:</b> Data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Rates for recent RSV-associated hospital admissions are subject to reporting delays; as new data are received each week, previous rates are updated accordingly.

<b>Note:</b> Preliminary burden estimates are not inclusive of data from all RSV-NET sites. Due to model limitations, sites with small sample sizes can impact estimates in unpredictable ways and are excluded for the benefit of model stability. CDC is working to address model limitations and include data from all sites in final burden estimates.

To supplement the national inventory of NIOSH Approved® N95 FFRs during times of extreme shortages, FFR reuse following decontamination is a possible strategy. Decontamination is a process to reduce the number of pathogens on used FFRs before reuse. An effective FFR decontamination technique should significantly reduce the pathogen burden, but not reduce a respirator’s filtration performance or its ability to fit properly. Another consideration is that no hazardous chemical residue should be left on the FFR following the decontamination process.",61,2

To prevent dermal, mucosal, or inhalation exposure to opioids and other hazardous drugs, first responders rely on personal protective equipment (PPE) – including respirators and gloves – as their last line of defense within the hierarchy of controls. NIOSH, in response to requests from first responders concerning appropriate glove selection (e.g., glove material, thickness), recommended for minimal and moderate anticipated opioid exposures powder-free nitrile gloves with a minimum thickness of 5 ± 2 mil (i.e., 0.13 ± 0.05 millimeters [mm]). Some glove manufacturers have recently marketed their gloves claiming fentanyl protection. There is limited empirical PPE performance data for opioids, and no industry standard or test method currently exists for evaluating PPE performance against opioids. The purpose of this study was to provide this empirical data under conditions representative of those encountered in the field to support (1) NIOSH’s current opioid PPE recommendations and (2) industry standards and test methods.",25,4

While knee-saving interventions like knee savers (KSs) and knee pads (KPs) have shown potential to reduce MSD risks, their effectiveness across different phases of shingle installation remains unknown. The objective of this study is to assess how interventions of KSs and KPs alleviate risks of MSDs in the knees during various phases of shingle installation. These phases encompass (1) reaching for shingles, (2) placing shingles, (3) grabbing a nail gun, (4) moving to the first nailing position, (5) nailing shingles, (6) replacing the nail gun, and (7) returning to an upright position. To collect data, nine male participants simulated the shingle installation task on a slope-adjustable roof platform (0°, 15°, and 30° slopes) under four intervention conditions: no intervention (NO), with KPs only (KP), with KSs only (KS), and with both KPs and KSs (BO) in a laboratory setting. Knee parameters including maximum flexion, abduction, adduction, and internal/external rotations were measured at all phases to assess intervention impacts through statistical analysis.",11,1

Eight participants (5 males and 3 females) performed 4 different patient handling tasks, including 1) lying to sitting, 2) sitting to standing, 3) standing to sitting, and 4) bed to wheelchair transfer with and without the exoskeleton. In certain bed-to-chair patient handling tasks, the exoskeleton (Laevo V2.5) was found to significantly reduce the peak and median values of the hip flexion angles and muscle activities of erector spinae compared to no exoskeleton. The effect of the exoskeleton was task-dependent. The exoskeleton caused a greater reduction of the erector spinae muscle activities of symmetric exertions than the asymmetric exertions. With the exoskeleton, participants adjusted their patient handling strategies by decreasing the hip flexion but increasing the trunk extension. There was a lack of significant changes in the heart rate with the exoskeleton.  The results suggest that back-support exoskeletons could play a role in reducing the muscular demand of the low back during certain bed-to-chair patient handling tasks. However, further research would be needed to fully assess its effectiveness and practicality in improving patient-handling techniques.",10,1
