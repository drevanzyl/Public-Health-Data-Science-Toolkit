      "In the context of longitudinal data analysis, selecting the appropriate working correlation structure is crucial for obtaining efficient and meaningful estimates from marginal models, such as those fitted with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). The Quasi-Information Criterion (QIC) is a tool used for comparing the goodness-of-fit of models with different working correlation structures, where, generally speaking, a smaller QIC value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.\n",

This indicates that, among the models considered, the AR(1) model provides the best fit to the data according to the QIC. The AR(1) working correlation structure assumes that the correlation between observations decreases as the time gap between them increases, which is often a reasonable assumption in longitudinal studies.\n",

It's important to note, however, that while the QIC provides valuable guidance, the decision should also consider the context of the study, theoretical considerations, and the plausibility of the assumptions behind each working correlation structure. Additionally, assessing the robustness of the findings by examining diagnostics and sensitivity analyses is also a good practice.\n"
